	abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether a capitalist economy can ever sustain a ‘stationary’ (or nongrowing) state, or whether, as often claimed, capitalism has an inherent ‘growth imperative’ arising from the charging of interest on debt. We outline the development of a dedicated system dynamics macro-economic model for describing Financial Assets and Liabilities in a Stock-Flow consistent Framework ({FALSTAFF}) and use this model to explore the potential for stationary state outcomes in an economy with balanced trade, credit creation by banks, and private equity. Contrary to claims in the literature, we ﬁnd that neither credit creation nor the charging of interest on debt creates a ‘growth imperative’ in and of themselves. This ﬁnding remains true even when capital adequacy and liquidity requirements are imposed on banks. We test the robustness of our results in the face of random variations and one-off shocks. We show further that it is possible to move from a growth path towards a stationary state without either crashing the economy or dismantling the system. Nonetheless, there remain several good reasons to support the reform of the monetary system. Our model also supports critiques of austerity and underlines the value of countercyclical spending by government.},

Nordhaus has misrepresented the scientiﬁc literature to justify the using a smooth function to describe the damage to {GDP} from climate change. Correcting for these errors makes it feasible that the economic damages from climate change are at least an order of magnitude worse than forecast by economists, and may be so great as to threaten the survival of human civilization.},

              The replacement of internal combustion engines by electric vehicles ({EVs}) is being promoted towards the decarbonisation of the transportation sector. {EVs} require important amounts of materials, some of which are being assessed as potentially critical in the future. In this work, we develop a submodule of material requirements for transport for an integrated assessment model with great detail in the representation of electric transportation modes. This submodule includes the following novel characteristics: a portfolio of {EV} battery subtechnologies ({LMO}, {NMC}622, {NMC}811, {NCA} \& {LFP}) and {EV} chargers, including the required connections to the grid; comprehensive coverage of their material intensities; and a dynamic allocation function for {EV} battery subtechnologies, taking into account the changes over time of their Energy Stored Over energy Invested ({ESOI}) and material scarcities. We obtain {ESOI}
              st
              levels for household 4-wheelers in the range of 1.1–2.3 : 1 depending on the subtechnology, and lower than 1 : 1 for all subtechnologies when expanding the boundaries ({ESOI}
              final
              ) to include grids and chargers. The {NCA} and {NMC} subtechnologies are the best performing options in terms of {ESOI}; however, they are more dependent on critical materials such as nickel, cobalt and manganese. Expanding the boundaries to include chargers significantly increases the {GHG} footprint of {EVs}. The integration of these features into a dynamic modelling framework, including the demand of materials from the rest of the economy, allows us to analyse different decarbonisation strategies, taking into account the feedback between the energy and material dimensions. Simulating the {MEDEAS}-World model including the developed submodule until 2050 for 3 different global transport transition strategies, we find that reserves of copper (with significant contributions from {EV} chargers and railways), cobalt, lithium, manganese, nickel and graphite would be depleted in at least one of the scenarios studied. The Degrowth scenario puts less pressure on material endowments. Recycling is an important strategy to reduce criticalities, but its effectiveness is limited as the materials are trapped for long time periods in stocks in-use in the system, which is worsened by the growth-oriented nature of the current economic paradigm.},

In this theoretical study we propose a new type of damage functions that allows mapping economic losses in terms of how extreme global temperature changes are in relation to a coping range representing the capacity of a system to deal with the climate conditions experienced at a particular period of time. In these new damage functions, which can be applied to the regional and global scales, adaptation to a changing climate is introduced by allowing the reference climate to be a function of time instead of a fixed quantity. Different formulations of damage functions discussed in the literature arise as special cases.},

	abstract = {A high degree of consensus exists in the climate sciences over the role that human interference with the atmosphere is playing in changing the climate. Following the Paris Agreement, a similar consensus exists in the policy community over the urgency of policy solutions to the climate problem. The context for climate policy is thus moving from agenda setting, which has now been mostly established, to impact assessment, in which we identify policy pathways to implement the Paris Agreement. Most integrated assessment models currently used to address the economic and technical feasibility of avoiding climate change are based on engineering perspectives with a normative systems optimisation philosophy, suitable for agenda setting, but unsuitable to assess the socio-economic impacts of realistic baskets of climate policies. Here, we introduce a fully descriptive, simulation-based integrated assessment model designed speciﬁcally to assess policies, formed by the combination of (1) a highly disaggregated macroeconometric simulation of the global economy based on time series regressions (E3ME), (2) a family of bottom-up evolutionary simulations of technology diffusion based on cross-sectional discrete choice models ({FTT}), and (3) a carbon cycle and atmosphere circulation model of intermediate complexity ({GENIE}). We use this combined model to create a detailed global and sectoral policy map and scenario that sets the economy on a pathway that achieves the goals of the Paris Agreement with {\textgreater}66\% probability of not exceeding 2  C of global warming. We propose a blueprint for a new role for integrated assessment models in this upcoming policy assessment context.},

However, there has been little investigation of how political dynamics systematically influence these models’ development and outputs, or the implications for energy strategies, targets and interventions. Using in-depth interviews with 24 European modellers and policyworkers, we illuminate the politics of economic modelling within European Union ({EU}) energy policymaking, focusing on dynamics of contestation, differentiated influence and power relations within models’ a) framing of questions and problems; b) framing of scenarios and solutions; c) structural assumptions and d) definition of quantitative data inputs. We then consider deeper questions of e) access and exclusion, showing how modelling is used to silence critical voices and reinforce incumbent interests. We argue that understanding this politics of modelling is crucial to the implementation of sustainable energy transitions. We conclude with recommendations for researchers and policyworkers seeking to promote the use of alternative/innovative models in energy policy (within and beyond the {EU}), centring on reflexivity; recognition; and relationship-building. Developing multi-sectoral ‘communities of practice’ around innovative modelling approaches is vital in challenging a vicious circle of evidence and policy that legitimises business-as-usual in a dangerously warming world.},

The potentialities and novel insights that this framework brings are illustrated by the simulation of four variants of current trends with the {MEDEAS}-world model: the consideration of alternative plausible assumptions and methods, combined with the feedback-rich structure of the model, reveal dynamics and implications absent in classical models. Our results suggest that the continuation of current trends will drive significant biophysical scarcities and impacts which will most likely derive in regionalization (priority to security concerns and trade barriers), conflict, and ultimately, a severe global crisis which may lead to the collapse of our modern civilization. Despite depicting a much more worrying future than conventional projections of current trends, we however believe it is a more realistic counterfactual scenario that will allow the design of improved alternative sustainable pathways in future work.},

Interpreting modelled residual damages as unavoided L\&D, a few results emerge from the analysis. First, residual damages turn out to be significant under a variety of {IAMs}, and for a range of climate scenarios. This means that if {adaptationAdaptationis} undertaken optimally, there will remain a large amount of damages that are not eliminated. Second the ratio of {adaptationAdaptationto} total damages varies by region, so residual damages also vary for that reason. Third, residual damages will depend on the climate scenario as well as the discount rate and the assumed parameters of the climate model (equilibrium climate sensitivity) as well as those of the socioeconomic model (damage functions). These uncertainties are very large and so will be any projections of residual damages in the medium to long term. The chapter raises other aspects that could influence estimates of L\&D. An important one is that, since actual {adaptationAdaptationis} very unlikely to be optimal, the amount of Loss and {DamageLoss} and damagemay be influenced by the sources from which {adaptationAdaptationand} Loss and {DamageLoss} and damageprograms are financed. The level and structure of current limited financial resources is likely to result in {adaptationAdaptationthat} is significantly below the optimal level and thus result in significant L\&D.},

	abstract = {Face aux enjeux socioéconomiques, démocratiques, et environnementaux, la croissance économique comme fin en soi, ou comme condition nécessaire au « développement », est de nouveau remise en cause. Depuis le début du {XXIème} siècle, suscitant un intérêt grandissant et de vifs échanges, la Décroissance se fraie une place dans le débat. Après avoir resitué son émergence dans la perspective historique de la controverse qui s'est développée, au cours de la deuxième moitié du {XXe} siècle, autour de la croissance et du modèle de développement des pays industrialisés, nous suggérons une synthèse des principales idées et des propositions concrètes actuellement portées par ses partisans. Celles-ci soulèvent un certain nombre de questions complexes, pour lesquelles nous proposons d'apporter quelques éclairages à travers un exercice de modélisation prospective. Nous réalisons pour cela une série d'entretiens, qui visent à recueillir différentes visions détaillées et quantifiées de ce que pourraient être, selon les participants, des scénarios de Décroissance, ou - plus largement- des scénarios de transitions souhaitables et soutenables, notamment en termes d'évolution des institutions, des modes de vie et de consommation, pour la France. En parallèle de ces entretiens, nous développons un modèle spécifique de simulation dynamique de l'économie française, construit autour de l'analyse entrées-sorties, sur la base de données publiques, et incorporant un haut niveau de détail. A l'aide de cet outil macroéconomique, nous proposons alors d'explorer, sur un horizon à long terme (2060) les implications possibles de différents scénarios, dont ceux élaborés à partir des entretiens. Nous nous intéressons par exemple aux conséquences possibles en termes d'emploi, de finances publiques, de consommation d'énergie, d'émissions de polluants atmosphériques, et de production de déchets. Les résultats des simulations soulignent l'importance des choix institutionnels, des facteurs culturels, comportementaux, et « non-techniques », et le potentiel de certaines propositions des mouvements de la Décroissance. Ils invitent ainsi à ouvrir le débat autour de la construction collective d'un nouveau projet de société. Dans cette perspective, notre approche offre un support simple et efficace pour la compréhension commune et la délibération collective.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a macroeconomic model of endogenous growth that enables us to take into consideration both the economic impact of climate change and the pivotal role of private debt. Using the Goodwin-Keen approach [25], based on the Lotka-Volterra logic, we couple its nonlinear dynamics with abatement costs. Moreover, various damage functions `a la Nordhaus ([38]) and Dietz-Stern ([6]) reﬂect the loss in ﬁnal production due to the temperature increase caused by the rising levels of {CO}2 emissions. An empirical estimation of the model at the worldscale enables us to simulate plausible trajectories for the planetary business-as-usual scenario. Our main ﬁnding is that, even though the short-run impact of climate change on static economic fundamentals may seem prima facie rather minor, its long-run dynamic consequences may lead to an extreme downside. Under plausible circumstances, global warming forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output losses; the private debt overhang may eventually induce a global ﬁnancial collapse, even before climate change could cause serious damage to the production sector. Under more severe conditions, the interplay between global warming and debt may lead to a secular stagnation followed by a collapse in the second half of this century. We analyze the extent to which slower demographic growth or higher carbon pricing allow a global breakdown to be avoided. The paper concludes by examining the conditions under which the +1.5◦C target, adopted by the Paris Agreement (2015), could be reached.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews different approaches to modelling the energy transition towards a zero carbon economy. It identifies a number of limitations in current approaches such as a lack of consideration of out-of-equilibrium situations (like an energy transition) and non-linear feedbacks. To tackle those issues, the new open source integrated assessment model pymedeas is introduced, which allows the exploration of the design and planning of appropriate strategies and policies for decarbonizing the energy sector at World and {EU} level. The main novelty of the new open-source model is that it addresses the energy transition by considering biophysical limits, availability of raw materials, and climate change impacts. This paper showcases the model capabilities through several simulation experiments to explore alternative pathways for the renewable transition. In the selected scenarios of this work, future shortage of fossil fuels is found to be the most influential factor of the simulations system evolution. Changes in efficiency and climate change damages are also important determinants influencing model outcomes.},

	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.4640677},
	abstract = {This paper presents a nuanced exploration of the current economic models used by the European Commission, highlighting their required complements in the context of ecological transition policies in the European Union, such as the European Green Deal. It emphasises the need for and value of incorporating a broader range of complementary modelling tools and models that illuminate aspects often abstracted in conventional approaches. This would permit to anticipate more adequately the impacts of the environmental crisis, environmental policies and transition strategies, and to assess their economic consequences. The authors discuss the theoretical and operational challenges faced by current models (New Keynesian {DSGE} and {EEE}-{CGE} types) and suggest alternative empirical modelling approaches developed in academic and public institutions. The aim of this work is both to provide an exhaustive review of complementary operational models in collaboration with their research teams, and to prioritise model development and guide discussions towards more effective policy recommendations. By integrating additional and complementary models having comparative advantages in addressing specific policy questions, this paper argues that the inventory of modelling tools of the European Commission could be enhanced. This paper makes a case for a more diversified, holistic and robust approach to economic modelling, to make them more capable of supporting the design of efficient, feasible, fair and socially acceptable ecological transition strategies. It also calls for an institutional convergence and interdisciplinary dialogue between modelling teams to improve tools and to provide effective and systemic guidance to policymakers in the {EU}.},

The main focus here is an introduction to the {DICE}-2013R model (which is an acronym for the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy). The 2013 version is a major update from the last fully documented version, which was the {DICE}-2007 model (Nordhaus 2008). The purpose of this manual is to explain in a self-contained publication the structure, calculations, algorithmics, and results of the current version. Some of the materials has been published in earlier documents, but this manual attempts to combine the earlier materials in a convenient fashion. The author would like to thank the many co-authors and collaborators who have contributed to this project over the many decades of its development. More than any single person, my colleague and co-author Tjalling Koopmans was an intellectual and personal inspiration for this line of research.

Less than 10\% of the mean {SCCO}2 comes from impacts in annex 1 from annex 1 emissions, while over 45\% comes from impacts in the rest of the world ({RoW}) from {RoW} emissions.

These tend to vary in their conclusions on the scale and direction of the likely macroeconomic impacts of a low-carbon transition. This paper traces the characteristic discrepancies in models’ outcomes to their origins in diﬀerent macroeconomic theories, most importantly their treatment of technological innovation and ﬁnance. We comprehensively analyse the relevant branches of macroinnovation theory and group them into two classes: ‘Equilibrium’ and ‘Nonequilibrium’. While both approaches are rigorous and self-consistent, they frequently yield opposite conclusions for the economic impacts of low-carbon policies. We show that model outcomes are mainly determined by their representations of monetary and ﬁnance dimensions, and their interactions with investment, innovation and technological change. Improving these in all modelling approaches is crucial for strengthening the evidence base for policy making and gaining a more consistent picture of the macroeconomic impacts of achieving emissions reductions objectives. The paper contributes towards the ongoing eﬀort of enhancing the transparency and understanding of sophisticated model mechanisms applied to energy and climate policy analysis. It helps tackle the overall ‘black box’ critique, much-cited in policy circles and elsewhere.},

The paper examines the effects of long-term climate policies on energy security under different assumptions about {GDP} growth and fossil fuel availability. It uses a systematic energy security assessment framework and a set of global and regional indicators for risks associated with energy trade and resilience associated with diversity of energy options. The analysis shows that climate policies significantly reduce the risks and increase the resilience of energy systems in the first half of the century. Climate policies also make energy supply, energy mix, and energy trade less dependent upon assumptions of fossil resource availability and {GDP} growth, and thus more predictable than in the baseline scenarios.},

	abstract = {Recent global economic and environmental forecasts consistently show a trend of continuous decline in natural resources, degradation of environmental quality, increasing vulnerability of economic growth as a result of environmental stress, competition for land and natural resources, soaring energy prices and climate change. These forecasts partly rest on significant efforts by the scientific community over the past three decades to improve knowledge of the interactions between economic growth and the environment; particularly modelling methods have developed to become increasingly applied to the assessment of the environmental and economic consequences of various energy demand and greenhouse gas policies. However, the significantly diverging viewpoints of models developed by energy engineers, or ‘bottom-up’ ({BU}) models, and those developed by economists, or ‘top-down’ ({TD}) models, hinder effective dialogue and mutual understanding between researchers from different academic backgrounds. The purpose of this paper is to promote a constructive dialogue between modellers from each side of the modelling paradigms, based on a comparative critique of the {BU} {TIAM}-{FR} model and the {TD} {IMACLIM}-R model. The comparison terms extend from the theoretical foundations of each model to their structure and specifications, and applicability to policy assessment. Preliminary numerical simulations are developed to demonstrate the relevance of linking the two models, while the technical challenges and methodological limitations of coupled simulations are addressed.},

The number of alternatives that has been proposed for each category is vast, making it difficult to comprehend the variety of assumptions and formalizations underlying existing evolutionary-economic models. Our survey aims to clarify for each model component the choice range, formal expressions, associated assumptions, and possible techniques for formalization. Our study is unique in that it provides more information about the formal details of specific model components and is considerably more inclusive than earlier reviews.},

Are there particular patterns and mechanisms in transition processes? {TT} are defined as major, long-term technological changes in the way societal functions are fulfilled. {TT} do not only involve changes in technology, but also changes in user practices, regulation, industrial networks, infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture. This paper practices ‘appreciative theory’ [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Bellknap Press, Cambridge, {MA}, 1982] and brings together insights from evolutionary economics and technology studies. This results in a multi-level perspective on {TT} where two views of the evolution are combined: (i) evolution as a process of variation, selection and retention, (ii) evolution as a process of unfolding and reconfiguration. The perspective is empirically illustrated with a qualitative longitudinal case-study, the transition from sailing ships to steamships, 1780–1900. Three particular mechanisms in {TT} are described: niche-cumulation, technological add-on and hybridisation, riding along with market growth.},

We describe that the emergence of a new innovation system and changes in existing innovation systems co-evolve with the process of technological change. Therefore, it is necessary to create more insight in the dynamics of innovation systems. Traditional methods of innovation system analysis that mainly focus on the structure of innovation systems have proven to be insufficient. Therefore, we propose a framework that focuses on a number of processes that are highly important for well performing innovation systems. These processes are labeled as ‘functions of innovation systems’. After explaining this framework and embedding it in existing literature, we propose a method for systematically mapping those processes taking place in innovation systems and resulting in technological change. This method can be characterized as a process analysis or history event analysis. Clarifying examples are taken from the empirical field of Sustainable Technology Development.},

The model has the following key features. First, monetary and physical stocks and flows are explicitly formalised taking into account the accounting principles and the laws of thermodynamics. Second, Georgescu-Roegen's distinction between stock-flow and fund-service resources is adopted. Third, output is demand-determined but supply constraints might arise either due to environmental damages or due to the exhaustion of natural resources. Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data. Simulations are conducted to investigate the trajectories of key environmental, macroeconomic and financial variables under (i) different assumptions about the sensitivity of economic activity to the leverage ratio of firms and (ii) different types of green finance policies.},

This document is the final report of the project ”Danish participation in {IEA}-{ETSAP}, Annex {XII}, 2011-2013” under the Danish Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Programme ({EUDP}) 2010. A first complete draft of the {ETSAP} final report for Annesx {XII} will not be relaased until January 2015.
A new project, ”Danish participation in {IEA}-{ETSAP}, Annex {XIII}, 2014-2016” was granted by the {EUDP} 2013.
The current report from the Annex {XII} project is final edition of the preliminary edition Risø-R-1774, which was published in March 2011.
The use of the {ETSAP} tools is linked to many other projects focusing on model application worldwide. This includes the organisations and institutions gathering in the annual International Energy Workshops ({IEW}), which are held back-to-back with one of the {ETSAP} semi-annual workshops. In recent years the {ETSAP} modelling tools have contributed to several projects under the various European research programmes.},

However, deep uncertainty characterizes their design and their potential effects on growth, financial and credit market stability, and inequality. We develop the {EIRIN} flow-of-funds behavioural model to simulate the introduction of green fiscal policies and green sovereign bonds, and we display their effects on firms' investments in the brown and green sector, on unemployment, on the credit and bonds market. {EIRIN} is Stock-Flow Consistent and is rooted on a balance sheet approach. It adopts a Leontief production function with no substitution of the production factors, i.e., Labour, Capital, and Raw Materials. Its sectors are endowed with adaptive behaviours and expectations, and interact with the others and the foreign sector through a set of markets. Simulations show that green public policies can promote green growth by influencing firms’ expectations and the credit market. Green sovereign bonds represent a short-term win-win solution, while green fiscal measures have higher immediate distributive effects that induce negative feedbacks on the economy. These results are influenced by the conditions (fiscal, budgetary and public debt/{GDP}) in which both measures are implemented.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of climate policy instruments for the decarbonisation of the global electricity sector in a non-equilibrium economic and technology diffusion perspective. Energy markets are driven by innovation, path-dependent technology choices and diffusion. However, conventional optimisation models lack detail on these aspects and have limited ability to address the effectiveness of policy interventions because they do not represent decision-making. As a result, known effects of technology lock-ins are liable to be underestimated. In contrast, our approach places investor decisionmaking at the core of the analysis and investigates how it drives the diffusion of low-carbon technology in a highly disaggregated, hybrid, global macroeconometric model, {FTT}:Power-E3MG. Ten scenarios to 2050 of the electricity sector in 21 regions exploring combinations of electricity policy instruments are analysed, including their climate impacts. We show that in a diffusion and path-dependent perspective, the impact of combinations of policies does not correspond to the sum of impacts of individual instruments: synergies exist between policy tools. We argue that the carbon price required to break the current fossil technology lock-in can be much lower when combined with other policies, and that a 90\% decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2050 is affordable without early scrapping.},

The model uses the concepts of transition theory as a framework for assessing possible pathways by which a transition to a sustainable mobility society might happen. The modelling approach combines agent-based modelling techniques with a system dynamics structure. It is original in that there are two levels of agent. There are a small number of complex agents, which have an internal structure and are therefore subsystems within society, and a larger number of simple agents. Based on the {UK} data, the results show that Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles ({FCVs}) come to dominate, but only in the very long run (after 2030), while biofuels and {ICE} (Internal Combustion Engine)-electric hybrids are the main alternatives to the regime in the next 10–30 years, because a) they are already developed and b) they ﬁt better into current infrastructures. The model shows that technological transitions are most likely. Lifestyle change transitions require sustained pressure from the environment on society and behavioural change from consumers.},

Hence there is a need for macroeconomic tools that can help identify socially sustainable post-growth pathways. The emerging ﬁeld of ecological macroeconomics aims to address this need and features a number of new macroeconomic modelling approaches. This article provides (1) a review of modelling developments in ecological macroeconomics, based on the literature and interviews with researchers, and (2) an analysis of how the different models incorporate policy themes from the post-growth literature. Twenty-two ecological macroeconomic models were analysed and compared to eight policy themes. It was found that environmental interactions and the monetary system were treated most comprehensively. Themes of income inequality, work patterns, indicators of well-being, and disaggregated production were addressed with less detail, while alternative business models and cross-scale interactions were hardly addressed. Overall, the combination of input-output analysis with stock-ﬂow consistent modelling was identiﬁed as a promising avenue for developing macroeconomic models for a post-growth economy. However, due to the wide interpretation of what “the economy” entails, future research will beneﬁt from employing a range of approaches.},

We draw two main conclusions: firstly, the knowledge base and structure of these existing ecological macroeconomic models are relevant, alongside other types of models, for the creation of a new approach in economics. Secondly, the reviewed models are policy relevant, especially in the context of the complexity and urgency of rapid energy transitions, where increasingly policymakers require economic models able to capture real-world characteristics. However, further improvements are needed to these models and future research should focus on i) assuring comparability of models' results and their policy insights, ii) incorporation of the relationships between macroeconomics, finance and sustainability and iii) the institutionalization of a new approach in economics.},

We identify the transmission channels by which these green differentiated capital requirements ({GDCRs}) can affect credit provision and loan spreads, and we analyse these channels within a dynamic framework in which climate and macrofinancial feedback effects play a key role. Our main findings are as follows. First, {GDCRs} can reduce the pace of global warming and decrease thereby the physical financial risks. This reduction is quantitatively small, but is enhanced when the {GSF} and the {DPF} are implemented simultaneously or in combination with green fiscal policies. Second, the {DPF} reduces banks’ credit provision and leverage, making them less fragile. Third, both the {DPF} and the {GSF} generate some transition risks: the {GSF} increases bank leverage because it boosts green credit and the {DPF} increases loan defaults since it reduces economic activity. These effects are small in quantitative terms and are attenuated when there is a simultaneous implementation of the {DPF} and the {GSF}. Fourth, fiscal policies that boost green investment amplify the transition risks of the {GSF} and reduce the transition risks of the {DPF}; the combination of green fiscal policy with the {DPF} is thereby a potentially effective climate policy mix from a financial stability point of view.},

            Energy models are used to study emissions mitigation pathways, such as those compatible with the Paris Agreement goals. These models vary in structure, objectives, parameterization and level of detail, yielding differences in the computed energy and climate policy scenarios. To study model differences, diagnostic indicators are common practice in many academic fields, for example, in the physical climate sciences. However, they have not yet been applied systematically in mitigation literature, beyond addressing individual model dimensions. Here we address this gap by quantifying energy model typology along five dimensions: responsiveness, mitigation strategies, energy supply, energy demand and mitigation costs and effort, each expressed through several diagnostic indicators. The framework is applied to a diagnostic experiment with eight energy models in which we explore ten scenarios focusing on Europe. Comparing indicators to the ensemble yields comprehensive ‘energy model fingerprints’, which describe systematic model behaviour and contextualize model differences for future multi-model comparison studies.},

	shorttitle = {Assessing Financial Risks from Physical Climate Shocks},
	abstract = {Climate change has become a main concern of ministries of finance, central banks, and financial regulators. In response, a suite of scenarios and tools have been developed to assess the financial risks from physical climate shocks (for example, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, flooding). However, those scenarios do not fully capture such shocks, which could lead financial institutions to underestimate the potential scale of climate risks and underprice investments in resilience. This is particularly important for emerging markets and developing economies where exposure to physical climate risks is already high and is expected to further increase with climate change. The paper identifies five areas, or risk drivers, that make a material contribution to physical climate risks to the financial sector and that are not consistently included in current scenarios and tools: (1) extreme weather events, (2) uncertainties in climate models, (3) compound scenarios, (4) indirect economic impacts of shocks, and (5) feedback between the real economy and the financial sector. We derive a framework for generating scenarios to assess acute physical climate-related financial risks, which is inspired by the “Realistic Disaster Scenarios” that are used in risk management and supervision in the insurance sector. The framework is illustrated through an application of the {EIRIN} macroeconomic model. This framework aims to complement recent work by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System ({NGFS}) and the Financial Stability Board ({FSB}) to inform ministries of finance, central banks, financial regulators, and financial institutions on climate financial risk assessments, both for micro- and macroprudential risk management, and to incorporate climate risks into wider financial decision making and disclosures.},

However, financial actors’ reaction to climate finance initiatives, and their implications on decarbonization of the economy and on inequality, has not been assessed yet. Our manuscript contributes to address this knowledge gap by analysing under which conditions government’s climate finance policies and investors’ climate risk adjustment can affect the success of the low-carbon transition and the ability to close the green investment gap. We further develop the {EIRIN} Stock-Flow Consistent behavioural model with a financial market, an energy market and investors’ portfolio choice of financial contracts, for the European Union. First, we study the macroeconomic impacts of government’s green subsidies that can be financed either by introducing an unanticipated carbon tax or by issuing green sovereign bonds. Then, we assess how investors adjust firms’ risk assessment in reaction to the carbon tax introduction, and how this affects firms’ low-carbon investment decisions. We find that both a carbon tax and green bonds financing can give rise to trade-offs in terms of decarbonization of the economy (absolute emission reductions), distributive effects and public debt sustainability. The channels of transmission differ and are policy and instrument specific. Green subsidies that are financed by green sovereign bonds issuance generate positive spillovers on {GDP} growth and less distributive effects than a carbon tax. Nevertheless, due to the relative decoupling of the economy, {GDP} growth impairs emission reduction efforts. Finally, investors’ climate risk adjustment helps to smooth this trade-off, contributing to a full decoupling.},

	abstract = {Shifting our fossil-fuelled civilisation to clean modes of production and consumption requires deep transformations in our energy and economic systems. Innovation in physical technologies and social behaviours is key to this transformation. But innovation has not been at the heart of economic models of climate change. This paper reviews the state of the art on the economics of innovation, applies recent insights to climate change. The core insight is that technological innovation is a path-dependent process in which history and expectations matter greatly in determining eventual outcomes This insight has six important implications for climate policy design. First, efficient climate policy requires direct research subsidies for inducing and/or diffusing clean innovations, combined with carbon pricing (whether by taxes or trading). Second, both public and private sector involvement is required — private market forces need to be mobilised and redirected towards cleaner energy sources by governments. Third, path dependence and system inertia imply that delaying policies that redirect innovation towards clean technologies significantly increases costs in the future. Fourth, more developed countries should act as leaders in clean technology and should subsidise access to such technologies for less developed countries. At the same time, they should consider the possibility of using border carbon adjustments against any country that would take advantage of the new environmental policies by specialising in the production and export of fossil fuel intensive products. Fifth, if a transition from coal to clean energy is to be made via intermediates (for example, gas), the use of gas (without carbon capture) should be agreed to be on a time-limited basis. Further, to avoid gas lock-in, research in fully clean technologies would need to be strongly stepped up over the intervening period, along with other supportive policies. Finally, investment in coal should not be encouraged, as its continued use is only safe if we assume the cost-effectiveness of carbon capture and storage ({CCS}) technologies. While much greater efforts should be taken to reduce the costs of {CCS}, the speed that these technologies can be developed and deployed is uncertain.},

A calibration of our model at the scale of the world economy enables us to simulate various planetary scenarios. Our ﬁndings are threefold: 1) the +2 °C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the longterm (resp. short-term) results of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to severe economic consequences without the implementation (resp. in case of too rapid an application) of proactive climate policies. Global warming (resp. too fast transition) forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses (resp. to lower carbon emissions), thus endangering ﬁnancial stability; 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5 °C target.},

Insights from these complex models are widely used to advise policy-makers and to inform the general public. But up to now there has been little understanding of how these models can be evaluated and community-wide standards are missing. To answer this urgent question is a challenge because the systems are open and their future behavior is fundamentally unknown. In this paper, we discuss ways to overcome these problems. Reﬂecting on experience from other modeling communities, we develop an evaluation framework for {IAM} of global climate change. It builds on a systematic and transparent step-by-step demonstration of a model’s usefulness testing the plausibility of its behavior. Steps in the evaluation hierarchy are: setting up an evaluation framework, evaluation of the conceptual model, code veriﬁcation and documentation, model evaluation, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, documentation of the evaluation process, and communication with stakeholders. An important element in evaluating {IAM} of global climate change is the use of stylized behavior patterns derived from historical observation. The discussion of two examples is offered in this paper.},

Differences in treatment of these issues are substantial, and directly affect model results and their implied policy prescriptions.

It describes a broad range of possible futures and their relation to technical and socio-economic developments as well as policy choices. {REMIND} is a multiregional model incorporating the economy and a detailed representation of the energy sector implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System ({GAMS}). It uses non-linear optimization to derive welfare-optimal regional transformation pathways of the energy-economic system subject to climate and sustainability constraints for the time horizon from 2005 to 2100. The resulting solution corresponds to the decentralized market outcome under the assumptions of perfect foresight of agents and internalization of external effects. {REMIND} enables the analyses of technology options and policy approaches for climate change mitigation with particular strength in representing the scale-up of new technologies, including renewables and their integration in power markets. The {REMIND} code is organized into modules that gather code relevant for speciﬁc topics. Interaction between different modules is made explicit via clearly deﬁned sets of input and output variables. Each module can be represented by different realizations, enabling ﬂexible conﬁguration and extension. The spatial resolution of {REMIND} is ﬂexible and depends on the resolution of the input data.},

For such policies, the issue of endogenous technological change becomes important, both to estimate the overall costs and to identify the intertemporally cost-effective combination of mitigation options. In this paper, we first discuss the recent literature that evaluates the potential for endogenous technological change to reduce mitigation costs, and the efforts to incorporate endogenous technological change into pre-existing integrated assessment models. Then we formulate our own integrated assessment model, the Model of {INvestment} and Technological Development ({MIND}), which allows analysis of the relationship between specific mitigation options and the costs of ambitious climate protection objectives. Our model reveals two important results. First, the incorporation of technological change in a portfolio of mitigation options can reduce the costs of climate policies substantially. Achieving the ambitious policy goals necessary to avoid dangerous climate change becomes feasible without significant welfare losses. Second, the different mitigation options are of different importance in achieving climate protection goals: improving energy efficiency becomes too costly as a major mitigation option in the long run. In the long run, fossil fuels have to be substituted by renewable energy sources because a backstop technology with the potential of learning-by-doing has the strongest impact on reducing the welfare losses due to climate protection. Furthermore, Carbon Capturing and Sequestration can allow for further reduction in the costs of climate protection and can postpone the need to transform the energy system from a fossil-fuelbased one to a renewables one.},

	abstract = {{MESSAGE}–{MACRO} is the result of linking a macroeconomic model with a detailed energy supply model. The purpose of the linkage is to consistently reﬂect the inﬂuence of energy supply costs as calculated by the energy supply model in the optimal mix of production factors included in the macroeconomic model. In this article, we describe an automated link of two independently running models. The advantages of this setup over a single, fully integrated model are twofold: First, it is more ﬂexible, leaving the constituent models intact for independent runs, thus making further model development an easier task. Second, the decomposed model solution beneﬁts numerically from having the most non-linearities concentrated in the smaller of the two modules. The emphasis of the paper is on methodology, but we also include an example demonstrating the feedback mechanisms of {MESSAGE}–{MACRO} by applying it to two global economic–energy–environment scenarios. The two scenarios are a reference scenario and a scenario that limits the global atmospheric carbon concentration to 550 ppmv. The scenarios are compared in terms of {GDP}, energy supply and demand, and energy prices. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As examples, we consider effects on agriculture and human health. Progress requires a careful understanding of the chain of physical changes—global and regional temperature, precipitation, ocean acidification, polar ice melting. We relate those changes to other physical and biological variables that help people understand risks to factors relevant to their daily lives—crop yield, food prices, premature death, flooding or drought events, land use change. Finally, we investigate how societies may adapt, or not, to these changes and how the combination of measures to adapt or to live with losses will affect the economy. Valuation and assessment of market impacts can play an important role, but we must recognize the limits of efforts to value impacts where deep uncertainty does not allow a description of the causal chain of effects that can be described, much less assigned a likelihood. A mixed approach of valuing impacts, evaluating physical and biological effects, and working to better describe uncertainties in the earth system can contribute to the social dialogue needed to achieve consensus on the level and type of mitigation and adaptation actions.},

Using the {BET} model, we conduct simulations and obtain the following results. (1) Advanced end-use technologies have an important role in containing carbon prices as well as {GDP} losses when {GHG} (greenhouse gas) constraints are stringent. (2) Electrification based on energy services progresses rapidly in scenarios with stringent {GHG} constraints. This is because electricity can be supplied by various methods of non-fossil power generation, and advanced end-use technologies can drastically improve energy-to-service efficiencies. The {BET}’s results indicate the importance of analyses that systematically combine environmental constraints, end-use technologies, supply energy technologies, and economic development.},

	abstract = {Here we present an update to the {FaIR} model for use in probabilistic future climate and scenario exploration, integrated assessment, policy analysis, and education. In this update we have focussed on identifying a minimum level of structural complexity in the model. The result is a set of six equations, five of which correspond to the standard impulse response model used for greenhouse gas ({GHG}) metric calculations in the {IPCC}'s Fifth Assessment Report, plus one additional physically motivated equation to represent state-dependent feedbacks on the response timescales of each greenhouse gas cycle. This additional equation is necessary to reproduce non-linearities in the carbon cycle apparent in both Earth system models and observations. These six equations are transparent and sufficiently simple that the model is able to be ported into standard tabular data analysis packages, such as Excel, increasing the potential user base considerably. However, we demonstrate that the equations are flexible enough to be tuned to emulate the behaviour of several key processes within more complex models from {CMIP}6. The model is exceptionally quick to run, making it ideal for integrating large probabilistic ensembles. We apply a constraint based on the current estimates of the global warming trend to a million-member ensemble, using the constrained ensemble to make scenario-dependent projections and infer ranges for properties of the climate system. Through these analyses, we reaffirm that simple climate models (unlike more complex models) are not themselves intrinsically biased “hot” or “cold”: it is the choice of parameters and how those are selected that determines the model response, something that appears to have been misunderstood in the past. This updated {FaIR} model is able to reproduce the global climate system response to {GHG} and aerosol emissions with sufficient accuracy to be useful in a wide range of applications and therefore could be used as a lowest-common-denominator model to provide consistency in different contexts. The fact that {FaIR} can be written down in just six equations greatly aids transparency in such contexts.},

However, some economists and climate scientists have claimed that we need to use some kind of model for policy analysis and that {IAMs} can be structured and used in ways that correct for their shortcomings. For example, it has been argued that although we know very little about key relationships in the model, we can get around this problem by attaching probability distributions to various parameters and then simulating the model using Monte Carlo methods. I argue that this would buy us nothing and that a simpler and more transparent approach to the design of climate change policy is preferable.

Calamitous images of the future are not pathological or counterproductive: it is both necessary and valuable to imagine the worst-case scenarios of climate change. Critics of climate catastrophe often group together all visions of disastrous futures under labels like doomism or pessimism. This is unhelpful and greater nuance is required. We need to distinguish between climate doomists (who see catastrophe as imminent and unavoidable) and climate risk realists (who see catastrophe as one potential future that should be avoided). We also need to split apart the different ways of envisioning climate catastrophe to understand their distinct strengths and weaknesses. We outline and compare three alternative modes of viewing the worst-case scenarios of climate change: foresight, agitation, and fiction. The first centers on modeling catastrophic climate scenarios, the second on the use of images of climate catastrophe for political action, and the third on fictional visions of future climate disasters. These different approaches are complementary and should be better integrated to create more comprehensive models of the future. All of them would benefit from viewing the future as uncertain, reflecting on the social position of the author, and guarding against the authoritarian “stomp reflex” that can be induced by discussions of crisis and emergency.

They show how the use of such an approach allows them to identify policy mixes that have the potential to address the climate crisis without undermining macrofinancial and social stability.},

	abstract = {Using an ecological macrofinancial model, we explore the potential impact of the ‘green supporting factor’ ({GSF}) and the ‘dirty penalising factor’ ({DPF}) on climate-related financial risks. We identify the transmission channels by which these green differentiated capital requirements ({GDCRs}) can affect credit provision and loan spreads, and we analyse these channels within a dynamic framework in which climate and macrofinancial feedback effects play a key role. Our main findings are as follows. First, {GDCRs} can reduce the pace of global warming and decrease thereby the physical financial risks. This reduction is quantitatively small, but is enhanced when the {GSF} and the {DPF} are implemented simultaneously or in combination with green fiscal policies. Second, the {DPF} reduces banks’ credit provision and leverage, making them less fragile. Third, both the {DPF} and the {GSF} generate some transition risks: the {GSF} increases bank leverage because it boosts green credit and the {DPF} increases loan defaults since it reduces economic activity. These effects are small in quantitative terms and are attenuated when there is a simultaneous implementation of the {DPF} and the {GSF}. Fourth, fiscal policies that boost green investment amplify the transition risks of the {GSF} and reduce the transition risks of the {DPF}; the combination of green fiscal policy with the {DPF} is thereby a potentially effective climate policy mix from a financial stability point of view.},

This paper critically discusses the way that green fiscal policy has been analysed in both conventional and post-Keynesian approaches. It then uses a recently developed post-Keynesian ecological macroeconomic model in order to provide a comparative evaluation of three different types of green fiscal policy: carbon taxes, green subsidies and green public investment. We show that (i) carbon taxes reduce global warming but increase financial risks due to their adverse effects on the profitability of firms and credit availability; (ii) green subsidies and green public investment improve ecological efficiency, but their positive environmental impact is partially offset by their macroeconomic rebound effects; and (iii) a green fiscal policy mix derives better outcomes than isolated policies. Directions for future heterodox macroeconomic research on the links between fiscal policy and ecological sustainability are suggested.},

Second, Georgescu-Roegen's distinction between stock-flow and fund-service resources is adopted. Third, output is demand-determined but supply constraints might arise either due to environmental damages or due to the exhaustion of natural resources. Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data.

The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016–2120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate {QE} programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming.

Although historical records indicate that economic shocks might lead to financial instability, few studies have focused on the impact of climate change on the financial actors5,6. This paper examines how climate-related damages impact the stability of the global banking system. We use an agent-based climate–macroeconomic model calibrated on stylized facts, future scenarios and climate impact functions7 affecting labour and capital. Our results indicate that climate change will increase the frequency of banking crises (26–248\%). Rescuing insolvent banks will cause an additional fiscal burden of approximately 5–15\% of gross domestic product per year and increase the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product by a factor of 2. We estimate that around 20\% of such effects are caused by the deterioration of banks’ balance sheets induced by climate change. Macroprudential regulation attenuates bailout costs, but only moderately. Our results show that leaving the financial system out of climate–economy integrated assessment may lead to an underestimation of climate impacts and that financial regulation can play a role in mitigating them.},

	abstract = {Which policies can increase the resilience of the financial system to climate risks? Recent evidence on the significant impacts of climate change and natural disasters on firms, banks and other financial institutions call for a prompt policy response. In this paper, we employ a macro-financial agent-based model to study the interaction between climate change, credit and economic dynamics and test a mix of policy interventions. We first show that financial constraints exacerbate the impact of climate shocks on the economy while, at the same time, climate damages to firms make the banking sector more prone to crises. We find that credit provision can both increase firms’ productivity and their financial fragility, with such a trade-off being exacerbated by the effects of climate change. We then test a set of “green” finance policies addressing these risks, while fostering climate change mitigation: i) green Basel-type capital requirements, ii) green public guarantees to credit, and iii) carbon-risk adjustment in credit ratings. All the policies reduce carbon emissions and the resulting climate impacts, though moderately. However, their effects on financial and real dynamics is not straightforwardly positive. Some combinations of policies fuel credit booms, exacerbating financial instability and increasing public debt. We show that the combination of the three policies leads to a virtuous cycle of (mild) emission reductions, stable financial sector and high economic growth. Additional tools would be needed to fully adapt to climate change. Hence, our results point to the need to complement financial policies cooling down climate-related risks with mitigation policies curbing emissions from real economic activities.},

The Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes ({DSK}) model is composed of heterogeneous firms belonging to capital-good, consumption-good and energy sectors. Production and energy generation lead to greenhouse gas emissions, which affect temperature dynamics. Climate damages are modelled at the individual level as stochastic shocks hitting workers' labour productivity, energy efficiency, capital stock and inventories of firms. In that, aggregate damages emerge from the aggregation of losses suffered by heterogeneous, interacting and boundedly rational agents. The model is run focusing on a business-as-usual carbon-intensive scenario consistent with a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. We find that the {DSK} model is able to account for a wide ensemble of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning both economic and climate dynamics. Simulation experiments show a substantial lack of isomorphism between the effects of micro- and macro-level shocks, as it is typical in complex system models. In particular, different types of shocks have heterogeneous impact on output growth, unemployment rate, and the likelihood of economic crises, pointing to the importance of the different economic channel affected by the shock. Overall, we report much larger climate damages than those projected by standard {IAMs} under comparable scenarios, suggesting possible shifts in the growth dynamics, from a self-sustained pattern to stagnation and high volatility, and the need of urgent policy interventions.},

The model comprises heterogeneous fossil-fuel and renewable plants, capital- and consumption-good firms and a climate box linking greenhouse gasses emission to temperature dynamics and microeconomic climate shocks affecting labour productivity and energy demand of firms. Simulation results show that the economy possesses two statistical equilibria: a carbon-intensive lock-in and a sustainable growth path characterized by better macroeconomic performances. Once climate damages are accounted for, the likelihood of a green transition depends on the damage function employed. While energy efficiency shocks (which raise the demand of energy) exert little effects on the macroeconomic performance compared to labour productivity impacts, they disproportionally harm the chances of an energy transition by exacerbating path-dependence in the process of technical change in favour of fossil-fuel technologies. Finally, we run a series of policy experiments on carbon (fossil fuel) taxes and green subsidies. We find that the effectiveness of such market-based instruments is limited, though it also depends upon the different channels climate change affects the economy through. Complementary policies might be required to avoid carbon-intensive lock-ins.},

Their results suggest that the emergence of tipping points due to unmitigated physical risks will reduce long-run growth and spur financial and economic instability. Moreover, diverse types of climate shocks have a different impact on economic dynamics and on the chances of observing a transition to carbonless growth. While these results call for immediate and ambitious interventions, appropriate mitigation policies need to be designed. The authors’ results show that carbon taxation is not the most suitable tool to achieve zero-emission growth, given its serious transition costs. On the contrary, command-and-control regulation and innovation policies to foster green investments are the key elements of the most promising policy mix to put the economy on a green growth pathway. Overall, their results contradict the standard tenets of cost–benefit climate economics and suggest the absence of any trade-off between decarbonization and growth.},

It adopts a Leontief production function with no substitution of the production factors, i.e., Labour, Capital, and Raw Materials.

Simulations show that green public policies can promote green growth by influencing firms’ expectations and the credit market. Green sovereign bonds represent a short-term win-win solution, while green fiscal measures have higher immediate distributive effects that induce negative feedbacks on the economy. These results are influenced by the conditions (fiscal, budgetary and public debt/{GDP}) in which both measures are implemented.},

In addition, a discussion emerged on the negative socio-economic and environmental externalities associated with fossil fuel subsidies. Nevertheless, pathways for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies in high income countries and their implications on the low-carbon transition have not yet been assessed. With the aim to narrow this knowledge gap, we extend the {EIRIN} Stock-Flow Consistent behavioral model to study the implications on sustainable development of the gradual phasing out of fossil fuels subsidies, whose revenues could be used by the government to subsidize energy investments in green capital (e.g. solar panels), either via fiscal policies or green bonds. We assess the effects on green growth, employment, credit and bonds market, as well as the distributive effects across heterogeneous households and sectors. A smooth phasing out of fossil fuels subsidies contributes to improve macroeconomic performance, to decrease inequality and helps the government to find fiscal space to support stable renewable energy policies. Renewable energy subsidies contribute to foster the low-carbon transition but could imply distributive effects, depending on the way in which they are implemented.},

In contrast, a disorderly transition worsens the economic performance and financial stability of the euro area. Further, in a disorderly transition with higher physical risks, real {GDP} decreases by 12.5\% in 2050 relative to an orderly transition. Second, we analyse how firms’ expectations about climate policy credibility (climate sentiments) affect investment decisions in high or low-carbon goods. Firms that trust an orderly policy introduction do anticipate the carbon tax and switch earlier to low-carbon investments. This, in turn, accelerates economic decarbonization and decreases the risk of carbon-stranded assets for investors. Our results highlight the crucial role of early and credible climate policies to signal investment decisions in the low-carbon transition.},

However, little is known about the risks of multiple climate extremes on critical infrastructures at regional to continental scales. Here we show how single- and multi-hazard damage to energy, transport, industrial, and social critical infrastructures in Europe are likely to develop until the year 2100 under the influence of climate change. We combine a set of high-resolution climate hazard projections, a detailed representation of physical assets in various sectors and their sensitivity to the hazards, and more than 1100 records of losses from climate extremes in a prognostic modelling framework. We find that damages could triple by the 2020s, multiply six-fold by mid-century, and amount to more than 10 times present damage of €3.4 billion per year by the end of the century due only to climate change. Damage from heatwaves, droughts in southern Europe, and coastal floods shows the most dramatic rise, but the risks of inland flooding, windstorms, and forest fires will also increase in Europe, with varying degrees of change across regions. Economic losses are highest for the industry, transport, and energy sectors. Future losses will not be incurred equally across Europe. Southern and south-eastern European countries will be most affected and, as a result, will probably require higher costs of adaptation. The findings of this study could aid in prioritizing regional investments to address the unequal burden of impacts and differences in adaptation capacities across Europe.},

We compute the {ToEI} using probabilistic climate change projections and impact functions from three integrated assessment models of climate change: {DICE}, {RICE} and {CLIMRISK}. Our results demonstrate that, in terms of the business-as-usual carbon emissions scenario, the global economy could reach its {ToEI} by 2095. Regional results highlight areas that are likely to reach the {ToEI} sooner, namely Western Europe by 2075, India by 2083, and Africa by 2085. We also explore local-scale variations in the {ToEI} demonstrating that, for example, Paris already reached the {ToEI} around 2020, while Shanghai will reach it around 2080. We conclude that the {ToEI} methodology can be applied to impact models of varying scales when sufficient historical impact data are available. Moreover, unprecedented impacts of climate change in the 21st century may be experienced even in economically developed regions in the {US} and Europe. Finally, moderate to stringent climate change mitigation policies could delay the extreme economic impacts of climate change by three decades in Latin America, the Middle East, and Japan, by two decades in India, Western Europe, and the {US}, and by one decade in Africa. Our results can be used by policymakers interested in implementing timely climate policies to prevent potentially large economic shocks due to climate change.},

An understanding of those tipping elements is of great interest given the increasing influence of humans on the biophysical Earth system. Complex interactions exist between tipping elements, e.g. physical mechanisms connect subsystems of the climate system. Based on earlier work on such coupled nonlinear systems, we systematically assessed the qualitative long-term behaviour of interacting tipping elements. We developed an understanding of the consequences of interactions on the tipping behaviour allowing for tipping cascades to emerge under certain conditions. The (narrative) application of these qualitative results to real-world examples of interacting tipping elements indicates that tipping cascades with profound consequences may occur: the interacting Greenland ice sheet and thermohaline ocean circulation might tip before the tipping points of the isolated subsystems are crossed. The eutrophication of the first lake in a lake chain might propagate through the following lakes without a crossing of their individual critical nutrient input levels. The possibility of emerging cascading tipping dynamics calls for the development of a unified theory of interacting tipping elements and the quantitative analysis of interacting real-world tipping elements.},

In particular, there are multiple potential tipping points and they are not all low-probability events; at least one has a significant probability of being passed this century under mid-range (2–4 °C) global warming, and they cannot all be ruled out at low ({\textless}2 °C) warming. In contrast, the dominant framing of climate catastrophes in {IAMs}, and in critiques of them, is that they are associated with high ({\textgreater} 4 °C) or very high ({\textgreater} 8 °C) global warming. This discrepancy could qualitatively alter the predictions of {IAMs}, including estimates of the social cost of carbon. To address this discrepancy and assess the economic impact of crossing different climate tipping points, we highlight a list of scientific points that should be considered, at least in a stylised form, in simplified {IAMs}. For nine different tipping events, the range of expected physical climate impacts is summarised and some suggestions are made for how they may translate into socio-economic impacts on particular sectors or regions. We also consider how passing climate tipping points could affect economic growth.},

	abstract = {Given the vast uncertainty surrounding climate impacts, meta-analyses of global climate damage estimates are a key tool for determining the relationship between temperature and climate damages. Due to limited data availability, previous meta-analyses of global climate damages potentially suffered from multiple sources of coefficient and standard error bias: duplicate estimates, omitted variables, measurement error, overreliance on published estimates, dependent errors, and heteroskedasticity. To address and test for these biases, we expand on previous datasets to obtain sufficient degrees of freedom to make the necessary model adjustments, including dropping duplicate estimates and including methodological variables. Estimating the relationship between temperature and climate damages using weighted least squares with cluster-robust standard errors, we find strong evidence that duplicate and omitted variable biases flatten the relationship. However, the magnitude of the bias greatly depends on the treatment of speculative high-temperature ({\textgreater}4 \$\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$C) damage estimates. Replacing the {DICE}-2013R damage function with our preferred estimate of the temperature–damage relationship, we find a three- to four-fold increase in the 2015 {SCC} relative to {DICE}, depending on the treatment of productivity. When catastrophic impacts are also factored in, the {SCC} increases by four- to five-fold.},

As models explore the uncertainty space within the boundaries of their objective functions, they risk providing scenarios which are too narrow and not sufficiently robust. Here, we apply robust and multi-objective decision-making methods to extract relevant information from a large ensemble of optimal emissions-reduction pathways generated by a regionalized cost-benefit integrated assessment model under deterministic welfare optimization. We show that shifting the focus from optimal to robust solutions reduces the uncertainty in mitigation strategies and aligns them toward the Paris goals. Moreover, we analyze the trade-offs between climatic (temperature), social (inequality) and economic (welfare) objectives and illustrate four robust pathways under various decision-making criteria. We show that robust mitigation strategies can lead to regional emission-reduction strategies which are fair. Our results show how to extract more comprehensive climate strategies from available scenario ensembles and that the highest discrepancies at the local level policies are found in the developing and most-impacted regions.},

	abstract = {The global financial crisis has forced standard macroeconomics to re-examine the plausibility of its assumptions and the adequacy of the policy prescriptions flowing from those assumptions. We believe a renewal of macroeconomic thinking and macroeconomic modeling is possible by recognizing that our economies should be analyzed as complex adaptive systems. A coherent and exhaustive representation of the inter-linkages between the real and financial sides of the economy is vital as well. We propose a macroeconomic framework based on a novel combination of the Agent Based and Stock Flow Consistent approaches. This paper presents a benchmark model for this innovative approach. Our model depicts an economy with capital and credit in which different types of agents locally interact on different markets. We provide a detailed representation of individual agents’ balance sheets, ensuring the model accounting consistency at the micro, meso, and macro levels. We analyze the properties of our simulated economy under different configurations of agent heuristics, focusing in particular on the role of credit and investment. We explain in detail the logic followed to calibrate and validate the model. Results show that our benchmark model is able to reproduce many stylized facts observed in real world, thus representing a good starting point to test -- in the next works -- different economic policies and institutional setups. Finally, the relatively simple and flexible structure of the model opens up many possibilities for development of the framework along different lines, thus providing a fertile soil for new applications.},

	abstract = {This paper discuss draft final results of a European research project (1998-2000) concerning the assessment of life cycle impacts on man and the environment and external costs of a wide variety of transportation technologies. The methodology is based on the {ExternE} (Externalities of Energy) Accounting framework. It allows to quantify and monetise impacts on public health, agriculture and materials, but ecological impacts could not be monetised. It results in external cost data that are site, trajectory and vehicle specific but on this basis more aggregated and generic data have been used. This also allows calculating external costs related to the supply of fuels, vehicles and infrastructure.

Overall, it shows that external environmental costs of transport are significant. For Belgium, notwithstanding stricter standards for new vehicles, overall external costs of passenger car traffic have hardly been reduced.},

In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data permit, the activity of the wealthy ({OECD}) countries, those countries with emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated. The dominant feature of the socio-economic trends is that the economic activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate. However, the differentiated graphs clearly show that strong equity issues are masked by considering global aggregates only. Most of the population growth since 1950 has been in the non-{OECD} world but the world’s economy ({GDP}), and hence consumption, is still strongly dominated by the {OECD} world. The Earth System indicators, in general, continued their long-term, post-industrial rise, although a few, such as atmospheric methane concentration and stratospheric ozone loss, showed a slowing or apparent stabilisation over the past decade. The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.},

	shorttitle = {A lost century in economics},
	abstract = {How do banks operate and where does the money supply come from? The financial crisis has heightened awareness that these questions have been unduly neglected by many researchers. During the past century, three different theories of banking were dominant at different times: (1) The currently prevalent financial intermediation theory of banking says that banks collect deposits and then lend these out, just like other non-bank financial intermediaries. (2) The older fractional reserve theory of banking says that each individual bank is a financial intermediary without the power to create money, but the banking system collectively is able to create money through the process of ‘multiple deposit expansion’ (the ‘money multiplier’). (3) The credit creation theory of banking, predominant a century ago, does not consider banks as financial intermediaries that gather deposits to lend out, but instead argues that each individual bank creates credit and money newly when granting a bank loan. The theories differ in their accounting treatment of bank lending as well as in their policy implications. Since according to the dominant financial intermediation theory banks are virtually identical with other non-bank financial intermediaries, they are not usually included in the economic models used in economics or by central bankers. Moreover, the theory of banks as intermediaries provides the rationale for capital adequacy-based bank regulation. Should this theory not be correct, currently prevailing economics modelling and policy-making would be without empirical foundation. Despite the importance of this question, so far only one empirical test of the three theories has been reported in learned journals. This paper presents a second empirical test, using an alternative methodology, which allows control for all other factors. The financial intermediation and the fractional reserve theories of banking are rejected by the evidence. This finding throws doubt on the rationale for regulating bank capital adequacy to avoid banking crises, as the case study of Credit Suisse during the crisis illustrates. The finding indicates that advice to encourage developing countries to borrow from abroad is misguided. The question is considered why the economics profession has failed over most of the past century to make any progress concerning knowledge of the monetary system, and why it instead moved ever further away from the truth as already recognised by the credit creation theory well over a century ago. The role of conflicts of interest and interested parties in shaping the current bank-free academic consensus is discussed. A number of avenues for needed further research are indicated.},

	shorttitle = {On the Economic Foundations of Green Growth Discourses},
	abstract = {‘Greening’ economic growth discourses are increasingly replacing the catchword of ‘sustainable development’ within national and international policy circles. The core of the argument is that the growth of modern economies may be sustained or even augmented, while policy intervention simultaneously ensures sustained environmental stewardship and improved social outcomes. But how well are these claims scientifically grounded or supported by economic theory, evidence, and applied modeling? We address this question with reference to the economic modeling of climate mitigation policies. We argue that orthodox economic equilibrium and optimization thinking offers, in effect, little support to and insufficiently meaningful interpretations of green growth claims. There are several exciting strands of new economic thinking that are emerging, offering a more robust and empirically validated understanding of the potential for green growth paths. Nonoptimizing simulation models are arguably in a better position to capture socioeconomic system dynamics and the role of macroeconomic policies for sustainability governance. An important caveat, nevertheless, is that when judged against the evidence, greening growth remains to some extent an oxymoron as to date there has been little evidence of substantial decoupling of {GDP} from carbon‐intensive energy use on a wide scale. Moreover, although the rhetoric on ‘greening the economy’ actively supports the need for policy intervention, the macroeconomic reasoning behind this, remains ambiguous. We finally suggest that, although focusing on the dichotomy between growth and the environment is clearly important, the quality of growth and beyond growth dimensions are at least as important for delivering improved macroeconomic governance for sustainability.

Two previous results remain: (4) The uncertainty about the impact is skewed towards negative surprises. (5) Poorer countries are much more vulnerable than richer ones. A meta-analysis of the impact of weather shocks reveals that studies, which relate economic growth to temperature levels, cannot agree on the sign of the impact whereas studies, which make economic growth a function of temperature change do agree on the sign but differ an order of magnitude in effect size. The former studies posit that climate change has a permanent effect on economic growth, the latter that the effect is transient. The impact on economic growth implied by studies of the impact of climate change is close to the growth impact estimated as a function of weather shocks. The social cost of carbon shows a similar pattern to the total impact estimates, but with more emphasis on the impacts of moderate warming in the near and medium term.},

We use econometric estimates of climate damages on {GDP} growth and explicitly model the uncertainty in the persistence time of damages. The Integrated Assessment Model we use includes the climate system and mitigation technology detail required to derive near-term policies. We find an optimal carbon price of \$115 per tonne of {CO}2 in 2030. The long-term persistence of damages, while highly uncertain, is a main driver of the near-term carbon price. Accounting for damages on economic growth increases the gap between the currently pledged nationally determined contributions and the welfare-optimal 2030 emissions by two thirds, compared to pathways considering the 2 ∘C limit only.},

	abstract = {Integrated assessment models ({IAMs}) of global climate change that combine representations of the economic and the climate system have become important tools to support policymakers in their responses to climate change. Yet,
              {IAMs}
              are built in the face of pervasive uncertainty, both scientific and ethical, which requires modelers to make numerous choices in model development. These modeling choices have epistemic, ethical, and political dimensions. First, modeling choices determine how well our current (lack of) knowledge about the elements and processes of the modeled system is represented. Second, modeling choices have ethical implications, for example, the choice of a social discount rate, which is well documented. For other modeling choices, the ethical assumptions and implications are more subtle. Third, climate‐economic models are not produced and used in a political vacuum; they shape and are shaped by the social relations they are embedded in. We review findings from various literatures to unpack the complex intersection of science, ethics, and politics that
              {IAMs}
              are developed and used in. This leads us to suggest theoretical frameworks that may enable an integrated epistemic–ethical–political understanding of
              {IAMs}
              and increase transparency about all three dimensions of model uncertainties.

	abstract = {The ‘Great Acceleration’ graphs, originally published in 2004 to show socio-economic and Earth System trends from 1750 to 2000, have now been updated to 2010. In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data permit, the activity of the wealthy ({OECD}) countries, those countries with emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated. The dominant feature of the socio-economic trends is that the economic activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate. However, the differentiated graphs clearly show that strong equity issues are masked by considering global aggregates only. Most of the population growth since 1950 has been in the non-{OECD} world but the world’s economy ({GDP}), and hence consumption, is still strongly dominated by the {OECD} world. The Earth System indicators, in general, continued their long-term, post-industrial rise, although a few, such as atmospheric methane concentration and stratospheric ozone loss, showed a slowing or apparent stabilisation over the past decade. The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.},

Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol loading regionally exceeds the boundary. Stratospheric ozone levels have slightly recovered. The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a historical perspective for the discussion on ecological economics as a special field of research. By studying the historical background of ecological economics, the present discussions and tensions inside the field might become easier to understand and to relate to. The study is inspired by other studies of the emergence of new research areas done by sociologists and historians of science, and includes both cognitive and social aspects, macro trends and the role of individuals. The basis for the paper is a combination of literature studies and interviews with key researchers from the field. The story opens with the emergence of the new environmental agenda in the 1960s, which was influenced by the scientific development in biology and ecology. Then it is outlined how the environmental challenge was met by economics in the 1960s. Around 1970, the basic ideas of ecological economics were given modern formulations, but it took a long gestation period from the beginning of the 1970s to the end of the 1980s, before ecological economics took shape. During this gestation period, the personal relationships between the actors were formed, and the meetings that were decisive for the formal establishment of ecological economics took place.},

	abstract = {How much and how fast should the globe reduce greenhouse-gas emissions? How should nations balance the costs of the reductions against the damages and dangers of climate change? This question has been addressed by the recent "Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change," which answers these questions clearly and unambiguously. We need urgent, sharp, and immediate reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. An analysis of the "Stern Review" finds that these recommendations depend decisively on the assumption of a near-zero social discount rate. The Review's unambiguous conclusions about the need for extreme immediate action will not survive the substitution of discounting assumptions that are consistent with today's market place.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ({SSPs}) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The {SSPs} are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The {SSPs} are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the {SSPs} depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of {SSP}-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 {EJ} in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual {CO}2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 {GtCO}2 to more than 120 {GtCO}2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2°C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the {SSP} marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the {SSPs} with high mitigation challenges. While the {SSPs} were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the {SSP} scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project ({CMIP}6).},

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways ({SSPs}). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the {SSPs} calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the {SSP} narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

We define {SSPs} as reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems over a century timescale, in the absence of climate change or climate policies. We introduce the concept of a space of challenges to adaptation and to mitigation that should be spanned by the {SSPs}, and discuss how particular trends in social, economic, and environmental development could be combined to produce such outcomes. A comparison to the narratives from the scenarios developed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios ({SRES}) illustrates how a starting point for developing {SSPs} can be defined. We suggest initial development of a set of basic {SSPs} that could then be extended to meet more specific purposes, and envision a process of application of basic and extended {SSPs} that would be iterative and potentially lead to modification of the original {SSPs} themselves.},

Based on literature analysis, quantitative document analysis and semi-structured interviews, we describe the historic evolution of the interactions between {IAMs} and policy-making between 1970 and 2015. We identify five historic phases in which {IAMs} played distinct mediating roles between science and policy, succeeding to adjust their scenario efforts to the continuously changing demands for knowledge from the policy community. In explaining the prominent role of {IAMs}, we differentiate between background conditions (material and sociological) and more contextual factors, most notably the flexible, hybrid and broad nature of {IAMs} as well as the pro-active character of the {IAM} community to enhance their policy relevance. We draw on the notion of institutional work to explain this success. In light of the urgency of responding to the climate crisis, we suggest that the {IAM} community may expand their scope of anticipated futures and consider engaging a wider range of publics and societal stakeholders beyond the science-policy interface.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Analysis of large scenario databases has become a critical tool for identifying climate mitigation strategies, as shown in the latest {IPCC} report. However, key elements of these strategies differ significantly among scenarios. Possible reasons include differences in climate target, models used, and assumptions on behavioral, technological and socio-economic developments. For policymaking, it is important to know which of these factors are the main cause of the spread, but quantification of this is still missing. Here, we aim to identify consensus in climate policy scenarios by analyzing how much of the variance in scenario outcomes can be explained by these factors, using Sobol decomposition. Some results, e.g. concerning future use of fossil and renewable resources, are mainly determined by climate target, while others, such as the composition of different renewables in the electricity mix and key outcomes of end-use sectors are more model dependent. Scenario aspects beyond model and climate outcome determine only a limited part of the variation, e.g., in nuclear power and hydrogen use, which suggests the need of more cross-model scenario variation. The outcomes put mitigation strategies in a new perspective by identifying which findings on the energy transition are robust and reveal key areas for future scenario development, model improvement and research.},

The permafrost feedback is increasingly positive in warmer climates, while the albedo feedback weakens as the ice and snow melt. Combined, these two factors lead to significant increases in the mean discounted economic effect of climate change: +4.0\% (\$24.8 trillion) under the 1.5 °C scenario, +5.5\% (\$33.8 trillion) under the 2 °C scenario, and +4.8\% (\$66.9 trillion) under mitigation levels consistent with the current national pledges.

Cost-benefit integrated assessment models that estimate the {SCCO}2 lack robust representations of climate feedbacks, economy feedbacks, and climate extremes. We compare the {PAGE}-{ICE} model with the decade older {PAGE}09 and find that {PAGE}-{ICE} yields {SCCO}2 values about two times higher, because of its climate and economic updates. Climate feedbacks only account for a relatively minor increase compared to other updates. Extending {PAGE}-{ICE} with economy feedbacks demonstrates a manifold increase in the {SCCO}2 resulting from an empirically derived estimate of partially persistent economic damages. Both the economy feedbacks and other increases since {PAGE}09 are almost entirely due to higher damages in the Global South. Including an estimate of interannual temperature variability increases the width of the {SCCO}2 distribution, with particularly strong effects in the tails and a slight increase in the mean {SCCO}2. Our results highlight the large impacts of climate change if future adaptation does not exceed historical trends. Robust quantification of climate-economy feedbacks and climate extremes are demonstrated to be essential for estimating the {SCCO}2 and its uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The {PAGE}-{ICE} integrated assessment model ({IAM}) is a new version of the Policy Analysis of Greenhouse Effect ({PAGE}) {IAM}. It is a major update of the two previous versions of the model called {PAGE}09 and {PAGE}2002 (Hope 2006, 2013). {PAGE}-{ICE} includes several updates both to climate science and economics from {IPCC} {AR}5 and literature that followed, as well as novel statistical emulators of nonlinear Arctic feedbacks presented in the study "Climate policy implications of nonlinear decline of Arctic land permafrost and other cryosphere elements" (Yumashev et al., 2019). This chapter provides a detailed overview of the updates in {PAGE}-{ICE} other than the statistical emulators of the nonlinear Arctic feedbacks, which are described in detail in the above-mentioned study (Yumashev et al., 2019). The updates in {PAGE}-{ICE} illustrate possible directions for future developments of all small-scale {IAMs} focusing on the total economic effect of climate change, a group of models that includes {PAGE}, {DICE} and {FUND}. The overarching goal of any such developments is to reduce the uncertainties in the model parameterisation according to the latest scientific results, and to make the models more transparent. Only with a constant pursuit of this goal will the indicative results from the small-scale {IAMs} be deemed relevant for advising on climate policy decisions. The {PAGE}-{ICE} model is one of the many necessary steps in this direction.},

The increase is the net result of several improvements that have been incorporated into the {PAGE}09 model in response to the critical debate around the Stern review: the adoption of the A1B socio-economic scenario, rather than A2 whose population assumptions are now thought to be implausible; the use of ranges for the two components of the discount rate, rather than the single values used in the Stern review; a distribution for the climate sensitivity that is consistent with the latest estimates from {IPCC} 2007a; less adaptation than in {PAGE}2002, particularly in the economic sector, which was criticised for possibly being over-optimistic; and a more theoretically-justified basis of valuation that gives results appropriate to a representative agent from the focus region, the {EU}.

	shorttitle = {Science as Social Knowledge},
	abstract = {Conventional wisdom has it that the sciences, properly pursued, constitute a pure, value-free method of obtaining knowledge about the natural world. In light of the social and normative dimensions of many scientific debates, Helen Longino finds that general accounts of scientific methodology cannot support this common belief. Focusing on the notion of evidence, the author argues that a methodology powerful enough to account for theories of any scope and depth is incapable of ruling out the influence of social and cultural values in the very structuring of knowledge. The objectivity of scientific inquiry can nevertheless be maintained, she proposes, by understanding scientific inquiry as a social rather than an individual process. Seeking to open a dialogue between methodologists and social critics of the sciences, Longino develops this concept of "contextual empiricism" in an analysis of research programs that have drawn criticism from feminists. Examining theories of human evolution and of prenatal hormonal determination of "gender-role" behavior, of sex differences in cognition, and of sexual orientation, the author shows how assumptions laden with social values affect the description, presentation, and interpretation of data. In particular, Longino argues that research on the hormonal basis of "sex-differentiated behavior" involves assumptions not only about gender relations but also about human action and agency. She concludes with a discussion of the relation between science, values, and ideology, based on the work of Habermas, Foucault, Keller, and Haraway.},

	abstract = {An urgent case for climate change action that forcefully sets out, in economic, ethical, and political terms, the dangers of delay and the benefits of action.The risks of climate change are potentially immense. The benefits of taking action are also clear: we can see that economic development, reduced emissions, and creative adaptation go hand in hand. A committed and strong low-carbon transition could trigger a new wave of economic and technological transformation and investment, a new era of global and sustainable prosperity. Why, then, are we waiting? In this book, Nicholas Stern explains why, notwithstanding the great attractions of a new path, it has been so difficult to tackle climate change effectively. He makes a compelling case for climate action now and sets out the forms that action should take.Stern argues that the risks and costs of climate change are worse than estimated in the landmark Stern Review in 2006—and far worse than implied by standard economic models. He reminds us that we have a choice. We can rely on past technologies, methods, and institutions—or we can embrace change, innovation, and international collaboration. The first might bring us some short-term growth but would lead eventually to chaos, conflict, and destruction. The second could bring about better lives for all and growth that is sustainable over the long term, and help win the battle against worldwide poverty. The science warns of the dangers of neglect; the economics and technology show what we can do and the great benefits that will follow; an examination of the ethics points strongly to a moral imperative for action.

In the first book-length analysis of the concept of a created scientific controversy, David Harker explores issues including climate change, Creation science, the anti-vaccine movement and genetically modified crops. Drawing on work in cognitive psychology, social epistemology, critical thinking and philosophy of science, he shows readers how to better understand, evaluate, and respond to the appearance of scientific controversy.

	abstract = {Weather and climate extremes cause huge economic damages and harm many lives each year (∼35000/year). There is evidence that some types of weather and climate extremes, like heat waves and flooding, have already increased or intensified over the last few decades, and climate projections reveal a further intensification for many types of weather and climate extremes in many regions though the uncertainties still remain large. While there is evidence for increases in economic losses it is uncertain whether this is due to an increase in the number and intensity of extreme events or can be attributed to socio-economic changes. However, there is agreement that the increasingly complex and internationally distributed supply chains of global companies make them more vulnerable to extreme weather events. It is also thought that global warming will adversely affect the global food supply chain and especially developing countries. Here I survey how weather and climate extremes impact our economies and how we can mitigate their impacts using financial and insurance products.},

Gabbay King's College, London, {UK}; Paul Thagard University of Waterloo, Canada; and John Woods University of British Columbia, Canada. Philosophy of Economics investigates the foundational concepts and methods of economics, the social science that analyzes the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. This groundbreaking collection, the most thorough treatment of the philosophy of economics ever published, brings together philosophers, scientists and historians to map out the central topics in the field. The articles are divided into two groups. Chapters in the first group deal with various philosophical issues characteristic of economics in general, including realism and Lakatos, explanation and testing, modeling and mathematics, political ideology and feminist epistemology. Chapters in the second group discuss particular methods, theories and branches of economics, including forecasting and measurement, econometrics and experimentation, rational choice and agency issues, game theory and social choice, behavioral economics and public choice, geographical economics and evolutionary economics, and finally the economics of scientific knowledge. This volume serves as a detailed introduction for those new to the field as well as a rich source of new insights and potential research agendas for those already engaged with the philosophy of economics.  Provides a bridge between philosophy and current scientific findings Encourages multi-disciplinary dialogue Covers theory and applications},

Although these are contained in the integrated models and their technical manuals, this paper brings them into the open in order to stimulate discussion. After briefly reviewing the benchmark climate change damage costs, region-specific cost functions are presented which distinguish tangible from intangible losses and the losses due to a changing climate from those due to a changed climate. Furthermore, cost functions are assumed to be quadratic, as an approximation of the unknown but presumably convex functions. Results from the damage module of the integrated climate economy {modelFUND} are presented. Next, uncertainties are incorporated and expected damages are calculated. It is shown that because of convex loss functions and right-skewed uncertainties, the risk premium is substantial, calling for more action than analysis based on best-guess estimates. The final section explores some needs for further scientific research.},

Ideally, one wants a functional form that captures reality adequately, yet is analytically sufficiently tractable to yield useful results. This paper gives two plausible risk aversion axioms that a reduced form utility function of temperature change and the capacity to produce consumption might reasonably be required to satisfy. These axioms indicate that the standard-practice multiplicative specification of disutility damages from global warming, as well as its additive analogue, are special cases of this paper's theoretically derived utility function. Empirically, the paper gives some numerical examples demonstrating the surprisingly strong implications for economic policy of the distinction between additive and multiplicative disutility damages.},

These advancements have in turn provided an opportunity to estimate these impacts across multiple economic sectors using a consistent set of damage functions. These functions can be used to inform decision making regarding the diversity and magnitude of future impacts and how adaptation and other actions can affect the risk of economic impacts. This article shows how damage functions can be developed from the results of detailed modeling studies and then used to estimate future economic impacts. We estimate damage functions based on 15 sectoral impact models that project the economic impacts of climate change on human health, infrastructure, and ecosystems and, with a focus on temperature, apply these functions to changes in economic impacts for seven U.S. regions through 2100. We also discuss the uncertainty of these results. We conclude that, although further research is needed, the methods presented here can be usefully applied to a range of alternative temperature trajectories to estimate the economic effects of climate change.},

	abstract = {Climate scientists have spent billions of dollars and eons of supercomputer time studying how increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and changes in the reflectivity of the earth’s surface affect dimensions of the climate system relevant to human society: surface temperature, precipitation, humidity, and sea levels. Recent incarnations of physical climate models have become sophisticated enough to be able to simulate intensities and frequencies of some extreme events, like tropical storms, under different warming scenarios. In a stark juxtaposition, the efforts involved in and the public resources targeted at understanding how these physical changes translate into economic impacts are disproportionately smaller, with most of the major models being developed and maintained with little to no public funding support. The goal of this paper is first to shed light on how (mostly) economists have gone about calculating the “social cost of carbon” for regulatory purposes and to provide an overview of the past and currently used estimates. In the second part, I will focus on where empirical economists may have the highest value added in this enterprise: specifically, the calibration and estimation of economic damage functions, which map weather patterns transformed by climate change into economic benefits and damages. A broad variety of econometric methods have recently been used to parameterize the dose (climate) response (economic outcome) functions. The paper seeks to provide an accessible and comprehensive overview of how economists think about parameterizing damage functions and quantifying the economic damages of climate change.},

Between the reflexive approach that intends to assess the effects of the interiorization of the symbolic violence generated by power relation and the performative approach, “art of interviewing” that implies a good amount of strategic anticipation, the researcher faces the objectification of the “culture of secrecy” as a standard of the functioning of the decision-making circles, a fortiori in military. Our purpose is not only to put into perspective this “culture of secrecy”, but also to show how it reveals the apprehensions and complexes of the researcher on his ground, whom, on the contrary at the end of the investigation will have to explain a relative fluidity of the speaking of the officers since the end of the Cold War, and especially what this disinhibition teaches him about his object of research.},

	abstract = {Convergence research is driven by specific and compelling problems and requires deep integration across disciplines. The potential of convergence research is widely recognized, but questions remain about how to design, facilitate, and assess such research. Here we analyze a seven-year, twelve-million-dollar convergence project on sustainable climate risk management to answer two questions. First, what is the impact of a project-level emphasis on the values that motivate and tie convergence research to the compelling problems? Second, how does participation in convergence projects shape the research of postdoctoral scholars who are still in the process of establishing themselves professionally? We use an interview-based approach to characterize what the project specifically enabled in each participant’s research. We find that (a) the project pushed participants’ research into better alignment with the motivating concept of convergence research and that this effect was stronger for postdoctoral scholars than for more senior faculty. (b) Postdocs’ self-assessed understanding of key project themes, however, appears unconnected to metrics of project participation, raising questions about training and integration. Regarding values, (c) the project enabled heightened attention to values in the research of a large minority of participants. (d) Participants strongly believe in the importance of explicitly reflecting on values that motivate and pervade scientific research, but they question their own understanding of how to put value-focused science into practice. This mismatch of perceived importance with poor understanding highlights an unmet need in the practice of convergence science.},

Our approach nests a standard efficiency based estimate and an equity weighted estimate as special cases. We use two integrated assessment models ({FUND} and {RICE}) to present quantitative estimates of the social cost of carbon. Our results suggest that inequality considerations lead to higher (lower) social cost of carbon values in high (low) income regions relative to an efficiency based approach, but that the effect is less strong than found in previous studies that used equity weighting. Our central estimate is that the social cost of carbon increases roughly by a factor of two to three, and even more for higher degrees of inequality aversion, when our disentangled equity weighting approach is used.},

A clear and transparent harmonisation process promotes a consistent interpretation of the modelling outcomes divergences and, reducing the model variance, is instrumental to the use of integrated assessment models to support policy decision-making. Despite its crucial role for climate economic policies, the definition of a comprehensive harmonisation methodology for integrated assessment modelling remains an open challenge for the scientific community. This paper proposes a framework for a harmonisation methodology with the definition of indispensable steps and recommendations to overcome stumbling blocks in order to reduce the variance of the outcomes which depends on controllable modelling assumptions. The harmonisation approach of the {PARIS} {REINFORCE} project is presented here to layout such a framework. A decomposition analysis of the harmonisation process is shown through 6 integrated assessment models ({GCAM}, {ICES}-{XPS}, {MUSE}, E3ME, {GEMINI}-E3, and {TIAM}). Results prove the potentials of the proposed framework to reduce the model variance and present a powerful diagnostic tool to feedback on the quality of the harmonisation itself.},

	abstract = {The Stern-Nordhaus controversy has been emblematic of the economic and ethical debate around the formulation of a discount rate and a carbon price. The aim of this article is to study this controversy in order to shed light on the epistemological and ethical postulates implicitly accepted by the two economists in their work, and more broadly in the integrated models concluding to a social cost of carbon. These implicitly accepted postulates are 1) the comprehension of economic rationality solely as the maximization of expected utility, and 2) a consequentialist point of view. The latter compartmentalize the scope of the ethical debate into cleavages over the formulation of an optimal discount rate. This article aims to broaden the ethical debate around these integrated models by questioning the implicit normativity of how economic rationality is at play in these models and proposes a new way of conceiving individual responsibility in regard to climate change.},

Its objective was to complete the transition of {UN} climate governance to the framework laid out in the Paris agreement in 2015. The report takes {COP}25 as a starting point, to examine how the current transition of climate governance is unfolding in practice, and what obstacles it is encountering. It places the focus not only on states and formal negotiation outcomes, but also on side-events, happenings and the role of wider civil society. Based on our observations, we argue that {UN} climate governance currently faces a set of distinct and partly conflicting expectations. We condense these into three stylized roles: the accountant, the admonisher, and the animator. After discussing each of these roles in turn, we go on to explore the dissonances and disconnects accompanying the current transformation of global climate governance. We relate these to institutional features and legacies of the {UNFCCC}, but also to new tensions that are rooted in inherent contradictions between the three roles. We conclude by reflecting on possible evolutions of global climate governance, sketching three plausible future scenarios.},

	abstract = {Global climate governance is in transition. As the focus shifts from negotiations to implementation, the quest for ways to effectively coordinate ambitious climate action has become a key concern. While existing studies frame this problem mostly in terms of institutional design (to “facilitate” state ambition) and strategic delegation of authority (to “orchestrate” nonstate action), this article builds on dramaturgical policy analysis to examine soft coordination in practice. Using ethnographic methods, we analyze public performances at the twenty-ﬁfth Conference of the Parties ({COP}25) in Madrid. We ﬁnd that these were shaped by preestablished governance scripts and social roles available to participants, but also by creative improvisations and interventions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat and {COP} Presidency intervened to conﬁgure the physical setting of the conference, mold its narrative arch, and shape available roles. We conclude that performances and dramaturgical interventions are important tools of soft coordination in global climate governance. Their analysis constitutes a productive entry point for grasping contemporary transformations in global politics.},

	shorttitle = {Circles of Global Climate Governance},
	abstract = {The working paper examines the {UN} climate conference ({COP}26) organised in Glasgow in November 2021 as a transnational mega-event, which constituted not only an important moment in international climate talks, but also a temporary convergence point for a multitude of actors and an arena for conflicts and contestation over framing within a broader global policy space. This perspective allows us to offer a view of the current state of global climate politics more comprehensive than those of analyses focused mainly on the negotiations. Using collaborative event ethnography, over two weeks eight researchers identified the material, spatial and social dimensions of the conference. We identify three circles of climate governance, which framed practices, interactions and debates in Glasgow. These comprise an inner circle of state-led negotiations (‘The In’), an official side programme (‘The Off’) and a relatively heterogeneous wider environment of self-organised events (‘The Fringe’). Each circle is populated by a different set of actors and enacts a distinct representation of ‘the global’. Our analysis of dynamics within each of these circles shows that climate governance has entered a new and contradictory phase, where some boundaries are blurred while others are reaffirmed, and where old conflicts resurface while new dividing lines appear. The Paris architecture for reporting and review has been finalised, but thus far the new approach has failed to close gaps between pledges and objectives for mitigation and climate finance. Global political and corporate elites have seemingly come to acknowledge the climate emergency and the need for a global low-carbon transformation, but the solutions proposed in Glasgow remained partial and fragile, and tightly contained within the dominant horizon of capitalist market- and techno-fixes. The communication strategy of the {UNFCCC} and the {UK} Presidency used increasingly radical terms to convey urgency and momentum, which in turn risked emptying activist notions of their content and force. A growing part of the climate movement reacted with critiques of corporate takeover and calls for “real zero” instead of “net zero”. In the conclusion, we examine a series of contentious issues and provide avenues for reflection on the future of climate governance.},
