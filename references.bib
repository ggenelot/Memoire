	url = {http://collections.unu.edu/view/UNU:9288},
	abstract = {The 2023 Interconnected Disaster Risks report examines six immediate and increasing risks across the world: the accelerating extinctions of species, the depletion of groundwater resources, the retreat of mountain glaciers, the growing number of places facing uninhabitable temperatures, the rise in uninsurability and the growing amount of space debris. Through literature review and expert consultation, we define “risk tipping points” for each of the six cases, representing the point at which a given socioecological system ceases to buffer risks and to provide its expected functions, after which the risk of catastrophic impacts to the system increases substantially. Our analysis also includes a highlight on the interconnectivity of root causes and drivers that are pushing these systems to their tipping point, as well as their influence on each other and compounding and cascading impacts into other systems, now and in the future. Our findings indicate that human actions are causing these increased risks, and we discuss the potential behavior and value changes that will be necessary to address them. This report also proposes a new framework to classify and discuss the effectiveness of solutions that help us address risk tipping points. Solutions fall into two main categories: Avoid solutions that target root causes and drivers of risk to avoid crossing risk tipping points altogether, and adapt solutions that help us to prepare or to better address the negative impacts of risk tipping point in case they cannot be avoided, and seek to adapt to the resulting changes in an attempt to live with them. Within each category, there are two options for actions: Delay actions work within the existing “business as usual” system and seek to slow down the progression towards risk tipping points or possible worst impacts. Transform actions involve a fundamental re-imagining of the system itself. Out of the different categories, it is transformative solutions that have the potential to move us away from a future of multiplying risk tipping points, but they also require the most societal and personal change. Therefore, the report highlights overall changes we can make to our behaviours and values that would transform the way we use our systems and reduce overall risk. These include a shift towards zero waste, a closer connection to nature, global cooperation and trust, consideration for future generations, and shifting to an economic model that is less focused on growth and more on human well-being within planetary boundaries. Addressing risk tipping points requires us to fundamentally change how we perceive and value the world around us in a way that gives us the responsibility to care for it. We must design our systems to work in a way that recognizes how much we need the world and all its systems working together for our survival; otherwise, we will find ourselves in a future where risks continue to multiply. The choice is ours. We have the power to act now to create the future we want.},

	abstract = {The lack of public support for climate change policies and refusals to vaccinate children are just two alarming illustrations of the impacts of dissent about scientific claims. Dissent can lead to confusion, false beliefs, and widespread public doubt about highly justified scientific evidence. Even more dangerously, it has begun to corrode the very authority of scientific consensus and knowledge. Deployed aggressively and to political ends, some dissent can intimidate scientists, stymie research, and lead both the public and policymakers to oppose important public policies firmly rooted in science.To criticize dissent is, however, a fraught exercise. Skepticism and fearless debate are key to the scientific process, making it both vital and incredibly difficult to characterize and identify dissent that is problematic in its approach and consequences. Indeed, as de Melo-Martín and Intemann show, the criteria commonly proposed as means of identifying inappropriate dissent are flawed and the strategies generally recommended to tackle such dissent are not only ineffective but could even make the situation worse.The Fight Against Doubt proposes that progress on this front can best be achieved by enhancing the trustworthiness of the scientific community and by being more realistic about the limits of science when it comes to policymaking. It shows that a richer understanding of the context in which science operates is needed to disarm problematic dissent and those who deploy it. This, the authors argue, is the best way forward, rather than diagnosing the many instances of wrong-headed dissent.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to address the neglected but important problem of differentiating between epistemically beneficial and epistemically detrimental dissent. By “dissent,” we refer to the act of objecting to a particular conclusion, especially one that is widely held. While dissent in science can clearly be beneficial, there might be some instances of dissent that not only fail to contribute to scientific progress, but actually impede it. Potential examples of this include the tobacco industry’s funding of studies that questioned the link between smoking and lung cancer, and the attempt by the petroleum industry and other groups to cast doubt upon the conclusion that human consumption of fossil fuels contributes to global climate change. The problem of distinguishing between good and bad dissent is important because of the growing tendency of some stakeholders to attempt to delay political action by ’manufacturing doubt’ (Oreskes \& Conway 2010). Our discussion in this paper focuses on climate science. This field, in our view, is rife with instances of bad dissent. On the basis of our discussion of climate science, we articulate a set of sufficient conditions for epistemically problematic dissent in general, which we call “the inductive risk account of epistemically detrimental dissent.”},

	abstract = {Scenarios for meeting ambitious climate targets rely on large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies (NETs), including direct air capture (DAC). However, the tradeoffs between food, water and energy created by deploying different NETs are unclear. Here we show that DAC could provide up to 3 GtCO2 yr−1 of negative emissions by 2035—equivalent to 7\% of 2019 global CO2 emissions—based on current-day assumptions regarding price and performance. DAC in particular could exacerbate demand for energy and water, yet it would avoid the most severe market-mediated effects of land-use competition from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and afforestation. This could result in staple food crop prices rising by approximately fivefold relative to 2010 levels in many parts of the Global South, raising equity concerns about the deployment of NETs. These results highlight that delays in aggressive global mitigation action greatly increase the requirement for DAC to meet climate targets, and correspondingly, energy and water impacts.},

	abstract = {Climate change is one of the most serious threats to the human habitat. The required structural change to limit anthropogenic forcing is expected to fundamentally change daily social and economic life. The production of iron and steel is a special case of economic activities since it is not only associated with combustion but particularly with process emissions of greenhouse gases which have to be dealt with likewise. Traditional mitigation options of the sector like efficiency measures, substitution with less emission-intensive materials, or scrap-based production are bounded and thus insufficient for rapid decarbonization necessary for complying with long-term climate policy targets. Iron and steel products are basic materials at the core of modern socio-economic systems, additionally being essential also for other mitigation options like hydro and wind power. Therefore, a system-wide assessment of recent technological developments enabling almost complete decarbonization of the sector is substantially relevant. Deploying a recursive-dynamic multi-region multi-sector computable general equilibrium approach, we investigate switches from coke-to hydrogen-based iron and steel technologies in a scenario framework where industry decisions (technological choice and timing) and climate policies are misaligned. Overall, we find that the costs of industry transition are moderate, but still ones that may represent a barrier for implementation because the generation deciding on low-carbon technologies and bearing (macro)economic costs might not be the generation benefitting from it. Our macroeconomic assessment further indicates that anticipated bottom-up estimates of required additional domestic renewable electricity tend to be overestimated. Relative price changes in the economy induce electricity substitution effects and trigger increased electricity imports. Sectoral carbon leakage is an imminent risk and calls for aligned course of action of private and public actors.},

This paper conducts a comprehensive review of techno-economic assumptions in the electricity sector among fifteen different global and national integrated assessment models. Particular focus is given to six major economies in the world: Brazil, China, the EU, India, Japan and the US. The comparison reveals that techno-economic characteristics are quite different across integrated assessment models, both for the base year and future years. It is, however, important to recognize that techno-economic assessments from the literature exhibit an equally large range of parameters as the integrated assessment models reviewed. Beyond numerical differences, the representation of technologies also differs among models, which needs to be taken into account when comparing numerical parameters. While desirable, it seems difficult to fully harmonize techno-economic parameters across a broader range of models due to structural differences in the representation of technology. Therefore, making techno-economic parameters available in the future, together with of the technology representation as well as the exact definitions of the parameters should become the standard approach as it allows an open discussion of appropriate assumptions.},

Under the current level of trade integration, climate change would lead to up to 55 million people who are undernourished in 2050. Without adaptation through trade, the impacts of global climate change would increase to 73 million people who are undernourished (+33\%). Reduction in tariffs as well as institutional and infrastructural barriers would decrease the negative impact to 20 million (−64\%) people. We assess the adaptation effect of trade and climate-induced specialization patterns. The adaptation effect is strongest for hunger-affected import-dependent regions. However, in hunger-affected export-oriented regions, partial trade integration can lead to increased exports at the expense of domestic food availability. Although trade integration is a key component of adaptation, it needs sensitive implementation to benefit all regions.},

We use econometric estimates of climate damages on GDP growth and explicitly model the uncertainty in the persistence time of damages. The Integrated Assessment Model we use includes the climate system and mitigation technology detail required to derive near-term policies. We find an optimal carbon price of \$115 per tonne of CO2 in 2030. The long-term persistence of damages, while highly uncertain, is a main driver of the near-term carbon price. Accounting for damages on economic growth increases the gap between the currently pledged nationally determined contributions and the welfare-optimal 2030 emissions by two thirds, compared to pathways considering the 2 ∘C limit only.},

	abstract = {A series of global actions have been made to address climate change. As a recent developed climate policy, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) have renewed attention to the importance of exploring temperature rise levels lower than 2 °C, in particular a long-term limit of 1.5 °C, compared to the preindustrial level. Nonetheless, achieving the 2 °C target under the current INDCs depends on dynamic socioeconomic development pathways. Therefore, this study conducts an integrated assessment of INDCs by taking into account different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). To that end, the CEEP-BIT research community develops the China’s Climate Change Integrated Assessment Model (C3IAM) to assess the climate change under SSPs in the context of with and without INDCs. Three SSPs, including “a green growth strategy” (SSP1), “a more middle-of-the-road development pattern” (SSP2) and “further fragmentation between regions” (SSP3) form the focus of this study. Results show that after considering INDCs, mitigation costs become very low and they have no evident positive changes in three SSPs. In 2100, a temperature rise would occur in SSP1-3, which is 3.20, 3.48 and 3.59 °C, respectively. There are long-term difficulties to keep warming well below 2 °C and pursue efforts toward 1.5 °C target even under INDCs. A drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is needed in order to mitigate potentially catastrophic climate change impacts. This work contributes on realizing the hard link between the earth and socioeconomic systems, as well as extending the economic models by coupling the global CGE model with the economic optimum growth model. In C3IAM, China’s energy consumption and emissions pattern are investigated and refined. This study can provide policy makers and the public a better understanding about pathways through which different scenarios could unfold toward 2100, highlights the real mitigation and adaption challenges faced by climate change and can lead to formulating effective policies.},

	abstract = {The working paper examines the UN climate conference (COP26) organised in Glasgow in November 2021 as a transnational mega-event, which constituted not only an important moment in international climate talks, but also a temporary convergence point for a multitude of actors and an arena for conflicts and contestation over framing within a broader global policy space. This perspective allows us to offer a view of the current state of global climate politics more comprehensive than those of analyses focused mainly on the negotiations. Using collaborative event ethnography, over two weeks eight researchers identified the material, spatial and social dimensions of the conference. We identify three circles of climate governance, which framed practices, interactions and debates in Glasgow. These comprise an inner circle of state-led negotiations (‘The In’), an official side programme (‘The Off’) and a relatively heterogeneous wider environment of self-organised events (‘The Fringe’). Each circle is populated by a different set of actors and enacts a distinct representation of ‘the global’. Our analysis of dynamics within each of these circles shows that climate governance has entered a new and contradictory phase, where some boundaries are blurred while others are reaffirmed, and where old conflicts resurface while new dividing lines appear. The Paris architecture for reporting and review has been finalised, but thus far the new approach has failed to close gaps between pledges and objectives for mitigation and climate finance. Global political and corporate elites have seemingly come to acknowledge the climate emergency and the need for a global low-carbon transformation, but the solutions proposed in Glasgow remained partial and fragile, and tightly contained within the dominant horizon of capitalist market- and techno-fixes. The communication strategy of the UNFCCC and the UK Presidency used increasingly radical terms to convey urgency and momentum, which in turn risked emptying activist notions of their content and force. A growing part of the climate movement reacted with critiques of corporate takeover and calls for “real zero” instead of “net zero”. In the conclusion, we examine a series of contentious issues and provide avenues for reflection on the future of climate governance.},

	abstract = {Global climate governance is in transition. As the focus shifts from negotiations to implementation, the quest for ways to effectively coordinate ambitious climate action has become a key concern. While existing studies frame this problem mostly in terms of institutional design (to “facilitate” state ambition) and strategic delegation of authority (to “orchestrate” nonstate action), this article builds on dramaturgical policy analysis to examine soft coordination in practice. Using ethnographic methods, we analyze public performances at the twenty-ﬁfth Conference of the Parties (COP25) in Madrid. We ﬁnd that these were shaped by preestablished governance scripts and social roles available to participants, but also by creative improvisations and interventions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat and COP Presidency intervened to conﬁgure the physical setting of the conference, mold its narrative arch, and shape available roles. We conclude that performances and dramaturgical interventions are important tools of soft coordination in global climate governance. Their analysis constitutes a productive entry point for grasping contemporary transformations in global politics.},

The aim of this article is to study this controversy in order to shed light on the epistemological and ethical postulates implicitly accepted by the two economists in their work, and more broadly in the integrated models concluding to a social cost of carbon. These implicitly accepted postulates are 1) the comprehension of economic rationality solely as the maximization of expected utility, and 2) a consequentialist point of view. The latter compartmentalize the scope of the ethical debate into cleavages over the formulation of an optimal discount rate. This article aims to broaden the ethical debate around these integrated models by questioning the implicit normativity of how economic rationality is at play in these models and proposes a new way of conceiving individual responsibility in regard to climate change.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of climate policy instruments for the decarbonisation of the global electricity sector in a non-equilibrium economic and technology diffusion perspective. Energy markets are driven by innovation, path-dependent technology choices and diffusion. However, conventional optimisation models lack detail on these aspects and have limited ability to address the effectiveness of policy interventions because they do not represent decision-making. As a result, known effects of technology lock-ins are liable to be underestimated. In contrast, our approach places investor decisionmaking at the core of the analysis and investigates how it drives the diffusion of low-carbon technology in a highly disaggregated, hybrid, global macroeconometric model, FTT:Power-E3MG. Ten scenarios to 2050 of the electricity sector in 21 regions exploring combinations of electricity policy instruments are analysed, including their climate impacts. We show that in a diffusion and path-dependent perspective, the impact of combinations of policies does not correspond to the sum of impacts of individual instruments: synergies exist between policy tools. We argue that the carbon price required to break the current fossil technology lock-in can be much lower when combined with other policies, and that a 90\% decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2050 is affordable without early scrapping.},

A clear and transparent harmonisation process promotes a consistent interpretation of the modelling outcomes divergences and, reducing the model variance, is instrumental to the use of integrated assessment models to support policy decision-making. Despite its crucial role for climate economic policies, the definition of a comprehensive harmonisation methodology for integrated assessment modelling remains an open challenge for the scientific community. This paper proposes a framework for a harmonisation methodology with the definition of indispensable steps and recommendations to overcome stumbling blocks in order to reduce the variance of the outcomes which depends on controllable modelling assumptions. The harmonisation approach of the PARIS REINFORCE project is presented here to layout such a framework. A decomposition analysis of the harmonisation process is shown through 6 integrated assessment models (GCAM, ICES-XPS, MUSE, E3ME, GEMINI-E3, and TIAM). Results prove the potentials of the proposed framework to reduce the model variance and present a powerful diagnostic tool to feedback on the quality of the harmonisation itself.},

The methodology is based on the ExternE (Externalities of Energy) Accounting framework. It allows to quantify and monetise impacts on public health, agriculture and materials, but ecological impacts could not be monetised. It results in external cost data that are site, trajectory and vehicle specific but on this basis more aggregated and generic data have been used. This also allows calculating external costs related to the supply of fuels, vehicles and infrastructure.

Overall, it shows that external environmental costs of transport are significant. For Belgium, notwithstanding stricter standards for new vehicles, overall external costs of passenger car traffic have hardly been reduced.},

It can be used to examine, for example, how changes in population, income, or technology cost might alter crop production, energy demand, or water withdrawals, or how changes in one region’s demand for energy affect energy, water, and land in other regions. This paper describes the model, including its assumptions, inputs, and outputs. We then use 11 scenarios, varying the socioeconomic and climate policy assumptions, to illustrate the results from the model. The resulting scenarios demonstrate a wide range of potential future energy, water, and land uses.

To catalyze such an approach to climate justice, this article develops an analysis of three instances of the intermingling of racism and environmental exploitation: climate adaptation practices in Lagos, Nigeria; the enmeshment of race and coal mining in the post–Civil War United States; and the infusing of precarity and rainforest destruction in Brazil.},

Our approach nests a standard efficiency based estimate and an equity weighted estimate as special cases. We use two integrated assessment models (FUND and RICE) to present quantitative estimates of the social cost of carbon. Our results suggest that inequality considerations lead to higher (lower) social cost of carbon values in high (low) income regions relative to an efficiency based approach, but that the effect is less strong than found in previous studies that used equity weighting. Our central estimate is that the social cost of carbon increases roughly by a factor of two to three, and even more for higher degrees of inequality aversion, when our disentangled equity weighting approach is used.},

	abstract = {Convergence research is driven by specific and compelling problems and requires deep integration across disciplines. The potential of convergence research is widely recognized, but questions remain about how to design, facilitate, and assess such research. Here we analyze a seven-year, twelve-million-dollar convergence project on sustainable climate risk management to answer two questions. First, what is the impact of a project-level emphasis on the values that motivate and tie convergence research to the compelling problems? Second, how does participation in convergence projects shape the research of postdoctoral scholars who are still in the process of establishing themselves professionally? We use an interview-based approach to characterize what the project specifically enabled in each participant’s research. We find that (a) the project pushed participants’ research into better alignment with the motivating concept of convergence research and that this effect was stronger for postdoctoral scholars than for more senior faculty. (b) Postdocs’ self-assessed understanding of key project themes, however, appears unconnected to metrics of project participation, raising questions about training and integration. Regarding values, (c) the project enabled heightened attention to values in the research of a large minority of participants. (d) Participants strongly believe in the importance of explicitly reflecting on values that motivate and pervade scientific research, but they question their own understanding of how to put value-focused science into practice. This mismatch of perceived importance with poor understanding highlights an unmet need in the practice of convergence science.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2°C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

Our purpose is not only to put into perspective this “culture of secrecy”, but also to show how it reveals the apprehensions and complexes of the researcher on his ground, whom, on the contrary at the end of the investigation will have to explain a relative fluidity of the speaking of the officers since the end of the Cold War, and especially what this disinhibition teaches him about his object of research.},

	abstract = {International trade enables us to exploit regional differences in climate change impacts and is increasingly regarded as a potential adaptation mechanism. Here, we focus on hunger reduction through international trade under alternative trade scenarios for a wide range of climate futures. Under the current level of trade integration, climate change would lead to up to 55 million people who are undernourished in 2050. Without adaptation through trade, the impacts of global climate change would increase to 73 million people who are undernourished (+33\%). Reduction in tariffs as well as institutional and infrastructural barriers would decrease the negative impact to 20 million (−64\%) people. We assess the adaptation effect of trade and climate-induced specialization patterns. The adaptation effect is strongest for hunger-affected import-dependent regions. However, in hunger-affected export-oriented regions, partial trade integration can lead to increased exports at the expense of domestic food availability. Although trade integration is a key component of adaptation, it needs sensitive implementation to benefit all regions.},

	abstract = {Climate scientists have spent billions of dollars and eons of supercomputer time studying how increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and changes in the reflectivity of the earth’s surface affect dimensions of the climate system relevant to human society: surface temperature, precipitation, humidity, and sea levels. Recent incarnations of physical climate models have become sophisticated enough to be able to simulate intensities and frequencies of some extreme events, like tropical storms, under different warming scenarios. In a stark juxtaposition, the efforts involved in and the public resources targeted at understanding how these physical changes translate into economic impacts are disproportionately smaller, with most of the major models being developed and maintained with little to no public funding support. The goal of this paper is first to shed light on how (mostly) economists have gone about calculating the “social cost of carbon” for regulatory purposes and to provide an overview of the past and currently used estimates. In the second part, I will focus on where empirical economists may have the highest value added in this enterprise: specifically, the calibration and estimation of economic damage functions, which map weather patterns transformed by climate change into economic benefits and damages. A broad variety of econometric methods have recently been used to parameterize the dose (climate) response (economic outcome) functions. The paper seeks to provide an accessible and comprehensive overview of how economists think about parameterizing damage functions and quantifying the economic damages of climate change.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in the availability of models and data to characterize the economic impacts of climate change have improved our ability to project both the physical impacts and economic effects of climate change across economic sectors of the United States. These advancements have in turn provided an opportunity to estimate these impacts across multiple economic sectors using a consistent set of damage functions. These functions can be used to inform decision making regarding the diversity and magnitude of future impacts and how adaptation and other actions can affect the risk of economic impacts. This article shows how damage functions can be developed from the results of detailed modeling studies and then used to estimate future economic impacts. We estimate damage functions based on 15 sectoral impact models that project the economic impacts of climate change on human health, infrastructure, and ecosystems and, with a focus on temperature, apply these functions to changes in economic impacts for seven U.S. regions through 2100. We also discuss the uncertainty of these results. We conclude that, although further research is needed, the methods presented here can be usefully applied to a range of alternative temperature trajectories to estimate the economic effects of climate change.},

These axioms indicate that the standard-practice multiplicative specification of disutility damages from global warming, as well as its additive analogue, are special cases of this paper's theoretically derived utility function. Empirically, the paper gives some numerical examples demonstrating the surprisingly strong implications for economic policy of the distinction between additive and multiplicative disutility damages.},

Although these are contained in the integrated models and their technical manuals, this paper brings them into the open in order to stimulate discussion. After briefly reviewing the benchmark climate change damage costs, region-specific cost functions are presented which distinguish tangible from intangible losses and the losses due to a changing climate from those due to a changed climate. Furthermore, cost functions are assumed to be quadratic, as an approximation of the unknown but presumably convex functions. Results from the damage module of the integrated climate economy modelFUND are presented. Next, uncertainties are incorporated and expected damages are calculated. It is shown that because of convex loss functions and right-skewed uncertainties, the risk premium is substantial, calling for more action than analysis based on best-guess estimates.

This groundbreaking collection, the most thorough treatment of the philosophy of economics ever published, brings together philosophers, scientists and historians to map out the central topics in the field. The articles are divided into two groups. Chapters in the first group deal with various philosophical issues characteristic of economics in general, including realism and Lakatos, explanation and testing, modeling and mathematics, political ideology and feminist epistemology. Chapters in the second group discuss particular methods, theories and branches of economics, including forecasting and measurement, econometrics and experimentation, rational choice and agency issues, game theory and social choice, behavioral economics and public choice, geographical economics and evolutionary economics, and finally the economics of scientific knowledge. This volume serves as a detailed introduction for those new to the field as well as a rich source of new insights and potential research agendas for those already engaged with the philosophy of economics.

There is evidence that some types of weather and climate extremes, like heat waves and flooding, have already increased or intensified over the last few decades, and climate projections reveal a further intensification for many types of weather and climate extremes in many regions though the uncertainties still remain large. While there is evidence for increases in economic losses it is uncertain whether this is due to an increase in the number and intensity of extreme events or can be attributed to socio-economic changes. However, there is agreement that the increasingly complex and internationally distributed supply chains of global companies make them more vulnerable to extreme weather events. It is also thought that global warming will adversely affect the global food supply chain and especially developing countries. Here I survey how weather and climate extremes impact our economies and how we can mitigate their impacts using financial and insurance products.},

The appearance of controversy, however, was misleading, designed to confuse the public and to protect industry interests. Created scientific controversies emerge when expert communities are in broad agreement but the public perception is one of profound scientific uncertainty and doubt. In the first book-length analysis of the concept of a created scientific controversy, David Harker explores issues including climate change, Creation science, the anti-vaccine movement and genetically modified crops. Drawing on work in cognitive psychology, social epistemology, critical thinking and philosophy of science, he shows readers how to better understand, evaluate, and respond to the appearance of scientific controversy. His book will be a valuable resource for students of philosophy of science, environmental and health sciences, and social and natural sciences.},

	abstract = {Conventional wisdom has it that the sciences, properly pursued, constitute a pure, value-free method of obtaining knowledge about the natural world. In light of the social and normative dimensions of many scientific debates, Helen Longino finds that general accounts of scientific methodology cannot support this common belief. Focusing on the notion of evidence, the author argues that a methodology powerful enough to account for theories of any scope and depth is incapable of ruling out the influence of social and cultural values in the very structuring of knowledge. The objectivity of scientific inquiry can nevertheless be maintained, she proposes, by understanding scientific inquiry as a social rather than an individual process. Seeking to open a dialogue between methodologists and social critics of the sciences, Longino develops this concept of "contextual empiricism" in an analysis of research programs that have drawn criticism from feminists. Examining theories of human evolution and of prenatal hormonal determination of "gender-role" behavior, of sex differences in cognition, and of sexual orientation, the author shows how assumptions laden with social values affect the description, presentation, and interpretation of data. In particular, Longino argues that research on the hormonal basis of "sex-differentiated behavior" involves assumptions not only about gender relations but also about human action and agency. She concludes with a discussion of the relation between science, values, and ideology, based on the work of Habermas, Foucault, Keller, and Haraway.},

	abstract = {An urgent case for climate change action that forcefully sets out, in economic, ethical, and political terms, the dangers of delay and the benefits of action.The risks of climate change are potentially immense. The benefits of taking action are also clear: we can see that economic development, reduced emissions, and creative adaptation go hand in hand. A committed and strong low-carbon transition could trigger a new wave of economic and technological transformation and investment, a new era of global and sustainable prosperity. Why, then, are we waiting? In this book, Nicholas Stern explains why, notwithstanding the great attractions of a new path, it has been so difficult to tackle climate change effectively. He makes a compelling case for climate action now and sets out the forms that action should take.Stern argues that the risks and costs of climate change are worse than estimated in the landmark Stern Review in 2006—and far worse than implied by standard economic models. He reminds us that we have a choice. We can rely on past technologies, methods, and institutions—or we can embrace change, innovation, and international collaboration. The first might bring us some short-term growth but would lead eventually to chaos, conflict, and destruction. The second could bring about better lives for all and growth that is sustainable over the long term, and help win the battle against worldwide poverty. The science warns of the dangers of neglect; the economics and technology show what we can do and the great benefits that will follow; an examination of the ethics points strongly to a moral imperative for action.

	abstract = {Energy and climate policies may have signiﬁcant economy-wide impacts, which are regularly assessed based on quantitative energy-environment-economy models. These tend to vary in their conclusions on the scale and direction of the likely macroeconomic impacts of a low-carbon transition. This paper traces the characteristic discrepancies in models’ outcomes to their origins in diﬀerent macroeconomic theories, most importantly their treatment of technological innovation and ﬁnance. We comprehensively analyse the relevant branches of macroinnovation theory and group them into two classes: ‘Equilibrium’ and ‘Nonequilibrium’. While both approaches are rigorous and self-consistent, they frequently yield opposite conclusions for the economic impacts of low-carbon policies. We show that model outcomes are mainly determined by their representations of monetary and ﬁnance dimensions, and their interactions with investment, innovation and technological change. Improving these in all modelling approaches is crucial for strengthening the evidence base for policy making and gaining a more consistent picture of the macroeconomic impacts of achieving emissions reductions objectives. The paper contributes towards the ongoing eﬀort of enhancing the transparency and understanding of sophisticated model mechanisms applied to energy and climate policy analysis. It helps tackle the overall ‘black box’ critique, much-cited in policy circles and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {The migration literature typically assumes that the migration of a household member is not associated with further variations in co-residence choices. We rely on a Mexican panel survey to provide novel evidence on the correlation between the occurrence of an international migration episode and changes in household composition. Migrant households have a higher probability of receiving a new member within one year around the migration episode. Attrition is significantly higher among migrant households, and we provide evidence that this is partly due to the dissolution of the household of origin of the migrant. The endogeneity of co-residence choices induces an undercount of migration episodes, as shown with data from the 2000 Census. This has implications for the analysis of migrant selection and of the effects on the individuals left behind. Dealing with these analytical challenges requires an approach to data collection that is less dependent on variations in household composition.},

              IAMs
              are built in the face of pervasive uncertainty, both scientific and ethical, which requires modelers to make numerous choices in model development. These modeling choices have epistemic, ethical, and political dimensions. First, modeling choices determine how well our current (lack of) knowledge about the elements and processes of the modeled system is represented. Second, modeling choices have ethical implications, for example, the choice of a social discount rate, which is well documented. For other modeling choices, the ethical assumptions and implications are more subtle. Third, climate‐economic models are not produced and used in a political vacuum; they shape and are shaped by the social relations they are embedded in. We review findings from various literatures to unpack the complex intersection of science, ethics, and politics that
              IAMs
              are developed and used in. This leads us to suggest theoretical frameworks that may enable an integrated epistemic–ethical–political understanding of
              IAMs

The default PAGE09 model gives a mean estimate of the social cost of CO2 (SCCO2) of \$106 per tonne of CO2, compared to \$81 from the PAGE2002 model used in the Stern review (Stern 2007). The increase is the net result of several improvements that have been incorporated into the PAGE09 model in response to the critical debate around the Stern review: the adoption of the A1B socio-economic scenario, rather than A2 whose population assumptions are now thought to be implausible; the use of ranges for the two components of the discount rate, rather than the single values used in the Stern review; a distribution for the climate sensitivity that is consistent with the latest estimates from IPCC 2007a; less adaptation than in PAGE2002, particularly in the economic sector, which was criticised for possibly being over-optimistic; and a more theoretically-justified basis of valuation that gives results appropriate to a representative agent from the focus region, the EU. The effect of each of these adjustments is quantified and explained.},

	abstract = {The PAGE-ICE integrated assessment model (IAM) is a new version of the Policy Analysis of Greenhouse Effect (PAGE) IAM. It is a major update of the two previous versions of the model called PAGE09 and PAGE2002 (Hope 2006, 2013). PAGE-ICE includes several updates both to climate science and economics from IPCC AR5 and literature that followed, as well as novel statistical emulators of nonlinear Arctic feedbacks presented in the study "Climate policy implications of nonlinear decline of Arctic land permafrost and other cryosphere elements" (Yumashev et al., 2019). This chapter provides a detailed overview of the updates in PAGE-ICE other than the statistical emulators of the nonlinear Arctic feedbacks, which are described in detail in the above-mentioned study (Yumashev et al., 2019). The updates in PAGE-ICE illustrate possible directions for future developments of all small-scale IAMs focusing on the total economic effect of climate change, a group of models that includes PAGE, DICE and FUND. The overarching goal of any such developments is to reduce the uncertainties in the model parameterisation according to the latest scientific results, and to make the models more transparent. Only with a constant pursuit of this goal will the indicative results from the small-scale IAMs be deemed relevant for advising on climate policy decisions. The PAGE-ICE model is one of the many necessary steps in this direction.},

Cost-benefit integrated assessment models that estimate the SCCO2 lack robust representations of climate feedbacks, economy feedbacks, and climate extremes. We compare the PAGE-ICE model with the decade older PAGE09 and find that PAGE-ICE yields SCCO2 values about two times higher, because of its climate and economic updates. Climate feedbacks only account for a relatively minor increase compared to other updates. Extending PAGE-ICE with economy feedbacks demonstrates a manifold increase in the SCCO2 resulting from an empirically derived estimate of partially persistent economic damages. Both the economy feedbacks and other increases since PAGE09 are almost entirely due to higher damages in the Global South. Including an estimate of interannual temperature variability increases the width of the SCCO2 distribution, with particularly strong effects in the tails and a slight increase in the mean SCCO2. Our results highlight the large impacts of climate change if future adaptation does not exceed historical trends. Robust quantification of climate-economy feedbacks and climate extremes are demonstrated to be essential for estimating the SCCO2 and its uncertainty.},

The permafrost feedback is increasingly positive in warmer climates, while the albedo feedback weakens as the ice and snow melt. Combined, these two factors lead to significant increases in the mean discounted economic effect of climate change: +4.0\% (\$24.8 trillion) under the 1.5 °C scenario, +5.5\% (\$33.8 trillion) under the 2 °C scenario, and +4.8\% (\$66.9 trillion) under mitigation levels consistent with the current national pledges. Considering the nonlinear Arctic feedbacks makes the 1.5 °C target marginally more economically attractive than the 2 °C target, although both are statistically equivalent.},

Today's mean social cost of CO2 is about \$100 per tonne of CO2 in the BAU scenario, and about \$50 per tonne in the low emissions scenario. The major influences on the SCCO2 are found to be the transient climate response, the pure time preference rate, the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption, the feedback response time of the earth and the weight on non-economic impacts. Less than 10\% of the mean SCCO2 comes from impacts in annex 1 from annex 1 emissions, while over 45\% comes from impacts in the rest of the world (RoW) from RoW emissions. About one third of the mean SCCO2 comes from impacts in the RoW caused by emissions in annex 1, while just over 10\% comes from impacts in annex 1 caused by emissions in the RoW.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Analysis of large scenario databases has become a critical tool for identifying climate mitigation strategies, as shown in the latest IPCC report. However, key elements of these strategies differ significantly among scenarios. Possible reasons include differences in climate target, models used, and assumptions on behavioral, technological and socio-economic developments. For policymaking, it is important to know which of these factors are the main cause of the spread, but quantification of this is still missing. Here, we aim to identify consensus in climate policy scenarios by analyzing how much of the variance in scenario outcomes can be explained by these factors, using Sobol decomposition. Some results, e.g. concerning future use of fossil and renewable resources, are mainly determined by climate target, while others, such as the composition of different renewables in the electricity mix and key outcomes of end-use sectors are more model dependent. Scenario aspects beyond model and climate outcome determine only a limited part of the variation, e.g., in nuclear power and hydrogen use, which suggests the need of more cross-model scenario variation. The outcomes put mitigation strategies in a new perspective by identifying which findings on the energy transition are robust and reveal key areas for future scenario development, model improvement and research.},

Based on literature analysis, quantitative document analysis and semi-structured interviews, we describe the historic evolution of the interactions between IAMs and policy-making between 1970 and 2015. We identify five historic phases in which IAMs played distinct mediating roles between science and policy, succeeding to adjust their scenario efforts to the continuously changing demands for knowledge from the policy community. In explaining the prominent role of IAMs, we differentiate between background conditions (material and sociological) and more contextual factors, most notably the flexible, hybrid and broad nature of IAMs as well as the pro-active character of the IAM community to enhance their policy relevance. We draw on the notion of institutional work to explain this success. In light of the urgency of responding to the climate crisis, we suggest that the IAM community may expand their scope of anticipated futures and consider engaging a wider range of publics and societal stakeholders beyond the science-policy interface.},

We define SSPs as reference pathways describing plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems over a century timescale, in the absence of climate change or climate policies. We introduce the concept of a space of challenges to adaptation and to mitigation that should be spanned by the SSPs, and discuss how particular trends in social, economic, and environmental development could be combined to produce such outcomes. A comparison to the narratives from the scenarios developed in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) illustrates how a starting point for developing SSPs can be defined. We suggest initial development of a set of basic SSPs that could then be extended to meet more specific purposes, and envision a process of application of basic and extended SSPs that would be iterative and potentially lead to modification of the original SSPs themselves.},

The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

REMIND, as an integrated assessment model (IAM), provides an integrated view of the global energy–economy–emissions system and explores selfconsistent transformation pathways. It describes a broad range of possible futures and their relation to technical and socio-economic developments as well as policy choices. REMIND is a multiregional model incorporating the economy and a detailed representation of the energy sector implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). It uses non-linear optimization to derive welfare-optimal regional transformation pathways of the energy-economic system subject to climate and sustainability constraints for the time horizon from 2005 to 2100. The resulting solution corresponds to the decentralized market outcome under the assumptions of perfect foresight of agents and internalization of external effects. REMIND enables the analyses of technology options and policy approaches for climate change mitigation with particular strength in representing the scale-up of new technologies, including renewables and their integration in power markets. The REMIND code is organized into modules that gather code relevant for speciﬁc topics. Interaction between different modules is made explicit via clearly deﬁned sets of input and output variables. Each module can be represented by different realizations, enabling ﬂexible conﬁguration and extension. The spatial resolution of REMIND is ﬂexible and depends on the resolution of the input data.},

In addition, the model captures the main economic interrelationships between world regions and is designed to analyze the optimal economic and environment policies in each world region as the outcome of a dynamic game. This paper provides a detailed description of the WITCH model, of its baseline, and of the model calibration procedure.},

	abstract = {Energy security is one of the main drivers of energy policies. Understanding energy security implications of long-term scenarios is crucial for informed policy making, especially with respect to transformations of energy systems required to stabilize climate change. This paper evaluates energy security under several global energy scenarios, modeled in the REMIND and WITCH integrated assessment models. The paper examines the effects of long-term climate policies on energy security under different assumptions about GDP growth and fossil fuel availability. It uses a systematic energy security assessment framework and a set of global and regional indicators for risks associated with energy trade and resilience associated with diversity of energy options. The analysis shows that climate policies significantly reduce the risks and increase the resilience of energy systems in the first half of the century. Climate policies also make energy supply, energy mix, and energy trade less dependent upon assumptions of fossil resource availability and GDP growth, and thus more predictable than in the baseline scenarios.},

The purpose of the linkage is to consistently reﬂect the inﬂuence of energy supply costs as calculated by the energy supply model in the optimal mix of production factors included in the macroeconomic model. In this article, we describe an automated link of two independently running models. The advantages of this setup over a single, fully integrated model are twofold: First, it is more ﬂexible, leaving the constituent models intact for independent runs, thus making further model development an easier task. Second, the decomposed model solution beneﬁts numerically from having the most non-linearities concentrated in the smaller of the two modules. The emphasis of the paper is on methodology, but we also include an example demonstrating the feedback mechanisms of MESSAGE–MACRO by applying it to two global economic–energy–environment scenarios. The two scenarios are a reference scenario and a scenario that limits the global atmospheric carbon concentration to 550 ppmv. The scenarios are compared in terms of GDP, energy supply and demand, and energy prices. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An understanding of those tipping elements is of great interest given the increasing influence of humans on the biophysical Earth system. Complex interactions exist between tipping elements, e.g. physical mechanisms connect subsystems of the climate system. Based on earlier work on such coupled nonlinear systems, we systematically assessed the qualitative long-term behaviour of interacting tipping elements. We developed an understanding of the consequences of interactions on the tipping behaviour allowing for tipping cascades to emerge under certain conditions. The (narrative) application of these qualitative results to real-world examples of interacting tipping elements indicates that tipping cascades with profound consequences may occur: the interacting Greenland ice sheet and thermohaline ocean circulation might tip before the tipping points of the isolated subsystems are crossed. The eutrophication of the first lake in a lake chain might propagate through the following lakes without a crossing of their individual critical nutrient input levels. The possibility of emerging cascading tipping dynamics calls for the development of a unified theory of interacting tipping elements and the quantitative analysis of interacting real-world tipping elements.},

	abstract = {‘Greening’ economic growth discourses are increasingly replacing the catchword of ‘sustainable development’ within national and international policy circles. The core of the argument is that the growth of modern economies may be sustained or even augmented, while policy intervention simultaneously ensures sustained environmental stewardship and improved social outcomes. But how well are these claims scientifically grounded or supported by economic theory, evidence, and applied modeling? We address this question with reference to the economic modeling of climate mitigation policies. We argue that orthodox economic equilibrium and optimization thinking offers, in effect, little support to and insufficiently meaningful interpretations of green growth claims. There are several exciting strands of new economic thinking that are emerging, offering a more robust and empirically validated understanding of the potential for green growth paths. Nonoptimizing simulation models are arguably in a better position to capture socioeconomic system dynamics and the role of macroeconomic policies for sustainability governance. An important caveat, nevertheless, is that when judged against the evidence, greening growth remains to some extent an oxymoron as to date there has been little evidence of substantial decoupling of GDP from carbon‐intensive energy use on a wide scale. Moreover, although the rhetoric on ‘greening the economy’ actively supports the need for policy intervention, the macroeconomic reasoning behind this, remains ambiguous. We finally suggest that, although focusing on the dichotomy between growth and the environment is clearly important, the quality of growth and beyond growth dimensions are at least as important for delivering improved macroeconomic governance for sustainability.

(2) The confidence interval about the estimates is much wider. (3) Elicitation methods are most pessimistic, econometric studies most optimistic. Two previous results remain: (4) The uncertainty about the impact is skewed towards negative surprises. (5) Poorer countries are much more vulnerable than richer ones. A meta-analysis of the impact of weather shocks reveals that studies, which relate economic growth to temperature levels, cannot agree on the sign of the impact whereas studies, which make economic growth a function of temperature change do agree on the sign but differ an order of magnitude in effect size. The former studies posit that climate change has a permanent effect on economic growth, the latter that the effect is transient. The impact on economic growth implied by studies of the impact of climate change is close to the growth impact estimated as a function of weather shocks. The social cost of carbon shows a similar pattern to the total impact estimates, but with more emphasis on the impacts of moderate warming in the near and medium term.},

	abstract = {The ‘Great Acceleration’ graphs, originally published in 2004 to show socio-economic and Earth System trends from 1750 to 2000, have now been updated to 2010. In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data permit, the activity of the wealthy (OECD) countries, those countries with emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated. The dominant feature of the socio-economic trends is that the economic activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate. However, the differentiated graphs clearly show that strong equity issues are masked by considering global aggregates only. Most of the population growth since 1950 has been in the non-OECD world but the world’s economy (GDP), and hence consumption, is still strongly dominated by the OECD world. The Earth System indicators, in general, continued their long-term, post-industrial rise, although a few, such as atmospheric methane concentration and stratospheric ozone loss, showed a slowing or apparent stabilisation over the past decade. The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.},

Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol loading regionally exceeds the boundary. Stratospheric ozone levels have slightly recovered. The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.},

	abstract = {How do banks operate and where does the money supply come from? The financial crisis has heightened awareness that these questions have been unduly neglected by many researchers. During the past century, three different theories of banking were dominant at different times: (1) The currently prevalent financial intermediation theory of banking says that banks collect deposits and then lend these out, just like other non-bank financial intermediaries. (2) The older fractional reserve theory of banking says that each individual bank is a financial intermediary without the power to create money, but the banking system collectively is able to create money through the process of ‘multiple deposit expansion’ (the ‘money multiplier’). (3) The credit creation theory of banking, predominant a century ago, does not consider banks as financial intermediaries that gather deposits to lend out, but instead argues that each individual bank creates credit and money newly when granting a bank loan. The theories differ in their accounting treatment of bank lending as well as in their policy implications. Since according to the dominant financial intermediation theory banks are virtually identical with other non-bank financial intermediaries, they are not usually included in the economic models used in economics or by central bankers. Moreover, the theory of banks as intermediaries provides the rationale for capital adequacy-based bank regulation. Should this theory not be correct, currently prevailing economics modelling and policy-making would be without empirical foundation. Despite the importance of this question, so far only one empirical test of the three theories has been reported in learned journals. This paper presents a second empirical test, using an alternative methodology, which allows control for all other factors. The financial intermediation and the fractional reserve theories of banking are rejected by the evidence. This finding throws doubt on the rationale for regulating bank capital adequacy to avoid banking crises, as the case study of Credit Suisse during the crisis illustrates. The finding indicates that advice to encourage developing countries to borrow from abroad is misguided. The question is considered why the economics profession has failed over most of the past century to make any progress concerning knowledge of the monetary system, and why it instead moved ever further away from the truth as already recognised by the credit creation theory well over a century ago. The role of conflicts of interest and interested parties in shaping the current bank-free academic consensus is discussed. A number of avenues for needed further research are indicated.},

By studying the historical background of ecological economics, the present discussions and tensions inside the field might become easier to understand and to relate to. The study is inspired by other studies of the emergence of new research areas done by sociologists and historians of science, and includes both cognitive and social aspects, macro trends and the role of individuals. The basis for the paper is a combination of literature studies and interviews with key researchers from the field. The story opens with the emergence of the new environmental agenda in the 1960s, which was influenced by the scientific development in biology and ecology. Then it is outlined how the environmental challenge was met by economics in the 1960s. Around 1970, the basic ideas of ecological economics were given modern formulations, but it took a long gestation period from the beginning of the 1970s to the end of the 1980s, before ecological economics took shape. During this gestation period, the personal relationships between the actors were formed, and the meetings that were decisive for the formal establishment of ecological economics took place.},

Differences in treatment of these issues are substantial, and directly affect model results and their implied policy prescriptions.

	abstract = {Given the vast uncertainty surrounding climate impacts, meta-analyses of global climate damage estimates are a key tool for determining the relationship between temperature and climate damages. Due to limited data availability, previous meta-analyses of global climate damages potentially suffered from multiple sources of coefficient and standard error bias: duplicate estimates, omitted variables, measurement error, overreliance on published estimates, dependent errors, and heteroskedasticity. To address and test for these biases, we expand on previous datasets to obtain sufficient degrees of freedom to make the necessary model adjustments, including dropping duplicate estimates and including methodological variables. Estimating the relationship between temperature and climate damages using weighted least squares with cluster-robust standard errors, we find strong evidence that duplicate and omitted variable biases flatten the relationship. However, the magnitude of the bias greatly depends on the treatment of speculative high-temperature ({\textgreater}4 \$\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}\$\$C) damage estimates. Replacing the DICE-2013R damage function with our preferred estimate of the temperature–damage relationship, we find a three- to four-fold increase in the 2015 SCC relative to DICE, depending on the treatment of productivity. When catastrophic impacts are also factored in, the SCC increases by four- to five-fold.},

	abstract = {Face aux enjeux socioéconomiques, démocratiques, et environnementaux, la croissance économique comme fin en soi, ou comme condition nécessaire au « développement », est de nouveau remise en cause. Depuis le début du XXIème siècle, suscitant un intérêt grandissant et de vifs échanges, la Décroissance se fraie une place dans le débat. Après avoir resitué son émergence dans la perspective historique de la controverse qui s'est développée, au cours de la deuxième moitié du XXe siècle, autour de la croissance et du modèle de développement des pays industrialisés, nous suggérons une synthèse des principales idées et des propositions concrètes actuellement portées par ses partisans. Celles-ci soulèvent un certain nombre de questions complexes, pour lesquelles nous proposons d'apporter quelques éclairages à travers un exercice de modélisation prospective. Nous réalisons pour cela une série d'entretiens, qui visent à recueillir différentes visions détaillées et quantifiées de ce que pourraient être, selon les participants, des scénarios de Décroissance, ou - plus largement- des scénarios de transitions souhaitables et soutenables, notamment en termes d'évolution des institutions, des modes de vie et de consommation, pour la France. En parallèle de ces entretiens, nous développons un modèle spécifique de simulation dynamique de l'économie française, construit autour de l'analyse entrées-sorties, sur la base de données publiques, et incorporant un haut niveau de détail. A l'aide de cet outil macroéconomique, nous proposons alors d'explorer, sur un horizon à long terme (2060) les implications possibles de différents scénarios, dont ceux élaborés à partir des entretiens. Nous nous intéressons par exemple aux conséquences possibles en termes d'emploi, de finances publiques, de consommation d'énergie, d'émissions de polluants atmosphériques, et de production de déchets. Les résultats des simulations soulignent l'importance des choix institutionnels, des facteurs culturels, comportementaux, et « non-techniques », et le potentiel de certaines propositions des mouvements de la Décroissance. Ils invitent ainsi à ouvrir le débat autour de la construction collective d'un nouveau projet de société. Dans cette perspective, notre approche offre un support simple et efficace pour la compréhension commune et la délibération collective.},

	abstract = {There is growing consensus on the fact that fossil fuel subsidies provided by governments in high-income countries represent a misalignment on emissions’ reduction with the global climate agenda. In addition, a discussion emerged on the negative socio-economic and environmental externalities associated with fossil fuel subsidies. Nevertheless, pathways for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies in high income countries and their implications on the low-carbon transition have not yet been assessed. With the aim to narrow this knowledge gap, we extend the EIRIN Stock-Flow Consistent behavioral model to study the implications on sustainable development of the gradual phasing out of fossil fuels subsidies, whose revenues could be used by the government to subsidize energy investments in green capital (e.g. solar panels), either via fiscal policies or green bonds. We assess the effects on green growth, employment, credit and bonds market, as well as the distributive effects across heterogeneous households and sectors. A smooth phasing out of fossil fuels subsidies contributes to improve macroeconomic performance, to decrease inequality and helps the government to find fiscal space to support stable renewable energy policies. Renewable energy subsidies contribute to foster the low-carbon transition but could imply distributive effects, depending on the way in which they are implemented.},

Agent-based modeling (ABM) represents autonomous entities, each with dynamic behavior and heterogeneous characteristics. Agents interact with each other and their environment, resulting in emergent outcomes at the macroscale that can be used to quantitatively analyze complex systems. ABM is contributing to research questions in ecological economics in the areas of natural resource management and land-use change, urban systems modeling, market dynamics, changes in consumer attitudes, innovation, and diffusion of technology and management practices, commons dilemmas and self-governance, and psychological aspects to human decision making and behavior change. Frontiers for ABM research in ecological economics involve advancing the empirical calibration and validation of models through mixed methods, including surveys, interviews, participatory modeling, and, notably, experimental economics to test specific decision-making hypotheses. Linking ABM with other modeling techniques at the level of emergent properties will further advance efforts to understand dynamics of social-environmental systems.},

	abstract = {Many now argue that we should think about the previously unthinkable risks of climate change, including societal collapses and human extinction. Calamitous images of the future are not pathological or counterproductive: it is both necessary and valuable to imagine the worst-case scenarios of climate change. Critics of climate catastrophe often group together all visions of disastrous futures under labels like doomism or pessimism. This is unhelpful and greater nuance is required. We need to distinguish between climate doomists (who see catastrophe as imminent and unavoidable) and climate risk realists (who see catastrophe as one potential future that should be avoided). We also need to split apart the different ways of envisioning climate catastrophe to understand their distinct strengths and weaknesses. We outline and compare three alternative modes of viewing the worst-case scenarios of climate change: foresight, agitation, and fiction. The first centers on modeling catastrophic climate scenarios, the second on the use of images of climate catastrophe for political action, and the third on fictional visions of future climate disasters. These different approaches are complementary and should be better integrated to create more comprehensive models of the future. All of them would benefit from viewing the future as uncertain, reflecting on the social position of the author, and guarding against the authoritarian “stomp reflex” that can be induced by discussions of crisis and emergency.

In the graphs of socio-economic trends, where the data permit, the activity of the wealthy (OECD) countries, those countries with emerging economies, and the rest of the world have now been differentiated. The dominant feature of the socio-economic trends is that the economic activity of the human enterprise continues to grow at a rapid rate. However, the differentiated graphs clearly show that strong equity issues are masked by considering global aggregates only. Most of the population growth since 1950 has been in the non-OECD world but the world’s economy (GDP), and hence consumption, is still strongly dominated by the OECD world. The Earth System indicators, in general, continued their long-term, post-industrial rise, although a few, such as atmospheric methane concentration and stratospheric ozone loss, showed a slowing or apparent stabilisation over the past decade. The post-1950 acceleration in the Earth System indicators remains clear. Only beyond the mid-20th century is there clear evidence for fundamental shifts in the state and functioning of the Earth System that are beyond the range of variability of the Holocene and driven by human activities. Thus, of all the candidates for a start date for the Anthropocene, the beginning of the Great Acceleration is by far the most convincing from an Earth System science perspective.},

In this paper, the authors employ an ecological stock–flow consistent model to provide a systems-based evaluation of certain macroeconomic, financial and sufficiency policies for climate mitigation.

	abstract = {A high degree of consensus exists in the climate sciences over the role that human interference with the atmosphere is playing in changing the climate. Following the Paris Agreement, a similar consensus exists in the policy community over the urgency of policy solutions to the climate problem. The context for climate policy is thus moving from agenda setting, which has now been mostly established, to impact assessment, in which we identify policy pathways to implement the Paris Agreement. Most integrated assessment models currently used to address the economic and technical feasibility of avoiding climate change are based on engineering perspectives with a normative systems optimisation philosophy, suitable for agenda setting, but unsuitable to assess the socio-economic impacts of realistic baskets of climate policies. Here, we introduce a fully descriptive, simulation-based integrated assessment model designed speciﬁcally to assess policies, formed by the combination of (1) a highly disaggregated macroeconometric simulation of the global economy based on time series regressions (E3ME), (2) a family of bottom-up evolutionary simulations of technology diffusion based on cross-sectional discrete choice models (FTT), and (3) a carbon cycle and atmosphere circulation model of intermediate complexity (GENIE). We use this combined model to create a detailed global and sectoral policy map and scenario that sets the economy on a pathway that achieves the goals of the Paris Agreement with {\textgreater}66\% probability of not exceeding 2  C of global warming. We propose a blueprint for a new role for integrated assessment models in this upcoming policy assessment context.},

	abstract = {In this work we develop an agent-based model that offers an alternative to standard, computable general equilibrium integrated assessment models (IAMs). The Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes (DSK) model is composed of heterogeneous firms belonging to capital-good, consumption-good and energy sectors. Production and energy generation lead to greenhouse gas emissions, which affect temperature dynamics. Climate damages are modelled at the individual level as stochastic shocks hitting workers' labour productivity, energy efficiency, capital stock and inventories of firms. In that, aggregate damages emerge from the aggregation of losses suffered by heterogeneous, interacting and boundedly rational agents. The model is run focusing on a business-as-usual carbon-intensive scenario consistent with a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. We find that the DSK model is able to account for a wide ensemble of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning both economic and climate dynamics. Simulation experiments show a substantial lack of isomorphism between the effects of micro- and macro-level shocks, as it is typical in complex system models. In particular, different types of shocks have heterogeneous impact on output growth, unemployment rate, and the likelihood of economic crises, pointing to the importance of the different economic channel affected by the shock. Overall, we report much larger climate damages than those projected by standard IAMs under comparable scenarios, suggesting possible shifts in the growth dynamics, from a self-sustained pattern to stagnation and high volatility, and the need of urgent policy interventions.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews different approaches to modelling the energy transition towards a zero carbon economy. It identifies a number of limitations in current approaches such as a lack of consideration of out-of-equilibrium situations (like an energy transition) and non-linear feedbacks. To tackle those issues, the new open source integrated assessment model pymedeas is introduced, which allows the exploration of the design and planning of appropriate strategies and policies for decarbonizing the energy sector at World and EU level. The main novelty of the new open-source model is that it addresses the energy transition by considering biophysical limits, availability of raw materials, and climate change impacts. This paper showcases the model capabilities through several simulation experiments to explore alternative pathways for the renewable transition. In the selected scenarios of this work, future shortage of fossil fuels is found to be the most influential factor of the simulations system evolution. Changes in efficiency and climate change damages are also important determinants influencing model outcomes.},

          , 
            
              The replacement of internal combustion engines by electric vehicles (EVs) is being promoted towards the decarbonisation of the transportation sector. EVs require important amounts of materials, some of which are being assessed as potentially critical in the future. In this work, we develop a submodule of material requirements for transport for an integrated assessment model with great detail in the representation of electric transportation modes. This submodule includes the following novel characteristics: a portfolio of EV battery subtechnologies (LMO, NMC622, NMC811, NCA \& LFP) and EV chargers, including the required connections to the grid; comprehensive coverage of their material intensities; and a dynamic allocation function for EV battery subtechnologies, taking into account the changes over time of their Energy Stored Over energy Invested (ESOI) and material scarcities. We obtain ESOI
              st
              levels for household 4-wheelers in the range of 1.1–2.3 : 1 depending on the subtechnology, and lower than 1 : 1 for all subtechnologies when expanding the boundaries (ESOI
              final
              ) to include grids and chargers. The NCA and NMC subtechnologies are the best performing options in terms of ESOI; however, they are more dependent on critical materials such as nickel, cobalt and manganese. Expanding the boundaries to include chargers significantly increases the GHG footprint of EVs. The integration of these features into a dynamic modelling framework, including the demand of materials from the rest of the economy, allows us to analyse different decarbonisation strategies, taking into account the feedback between the energy and material dimensions. Simulating the MEDEAS-World model including the developed submodule until 2050 for 3 different global transport transition strategies, we find that reserves of copper (with significant contributions from EV chargers and railways), cobalt, lithium, manganese, nickel and graphite would be depleted in at least one of the scenarios studied. The Degrowth scenario puts less pressure on material endowments. Recycling is an important strategy to reduce criticalities, but its effectiveness is limited as the materials are trapped for long time periods in stocks in-use in the system, which is worsened by the growth-oriented nature of the current economic paradigm.},

This paper describes the open-source MEDEAS modeling framework, which has been developed with the aim of informing decision-making to achieve the transition to sustainable energy systems with a focus on biophysical, economic, social and technological restrictions and tackling some of the limitations identified in the current IAMs. MEDEAS models include the following relevant characteristics: representation of biophysical constraints to energy availability; modeling of the mineral and energy investments for the energy transition, allowing a dynamic assessment of the potential mineral scarcities and computation of the net energy available to society; consistent representation of climate change damages with climate assessments by natural scientists; integration of detailed sectoral economic structure (input–output analysis) within a system dynamics approach; energy shifts driven by physical scarcity; and a rich set of socioeconomic and environmental impact indicators. The potentialities and novel insights that this framework brings are illustrated by the simulation of four variants of current trends with the MEDEAS-world model: the consideration of alternative plausible assumptions and methods, combined with the feedback-rich structure of the model, reveal dynamics and implications absent in classical models. Our results suggest that the continuation of current trends will drive significant biophysical scarcities and impacts which will most likely derive in regionalization (priority to security concerns and trade barriers), conflict, and ultimately, a severe global crisis which may lead to the collapse of our modern civilization. Despite depicting a much more worrying future than conventional projections of current trends, we however believe it is a more realistic counterfactual scenario that will allow the design of improved alternative sustainable pathways in future work.},

	abstract = {There is currently a huge gulf between natural scientists’ understanding of climate tipping points and economists’ representations of climate catastrophes in integrated assessment models (IAMs). In particular, there are multiple potential tipping points and they are not all low-probability events; at least one has a significant probability of being passed this century under mid-range (2–4 °C) global warming, and they cannot all be ruled out at low ({\textless}2 °C) warming. In contrast, the dominant framing of climate catastrophes in IAMs, and in critiques of them, is that they are associated with high ({\textgreater} 4 °C) or very high ({\textgreater} 8 °C) global warming. This discrepancy could qualitatively alter the predictions of IAMs, including estimates of the social cost of carbon. To address this discrepancy and assess the economic impact of crossing different climate tipping points, we highlight a list of scientific points that should be considered, at least in a stylised form, in simplified IAMs. For nine different tipping events, the range of expected physical climate impacts is summarised and some suggestions are made for how they may translate into socio-economic impacts on particular sectors or regions. We also consider how passing climate tipping points could affect economic growth.},

These assumptions include socio-economic projections, the magnitude and dynamics of climate impacts on the economy, and physical climate response. As models explore the uncertainty space within the boundaries of their objective functions, they risk providing scenarios which are too narrow and not sufficiently robust. Here, we apply robust and multi-objective decision-making methods to extract relevant information from a large ensemble of optimal emissions-reduction pathways generated by a regionalized cost-benefit integrated assessment model under deterministic welfare optimization. We show that shifting the focus from optimal to robust solutions reduces the uncertainty in mitigation strategies and aligns them toward the Paris goals. Moreover, we analyze the trade-offs between climatic (temperature), social (inequality) and economic (welfare) objectives and illustrate four robust pathways under various decision-making criteria. We show that robust mitigation strategies can lead to regional emission-reduction strategies which are fair. Our results show how to extract more comprehensive climate strategies from available scenario ensembles and that the highest discrepancies at the local level policies are found in the developing and most-impacted regions.},

	url = {https://hess.copernicus.org/preprints/9/9611/2012/hessd-9-9611-2012.pdf},
	abstract = {Abstract. There is an increasing need for strategic global assessments of flood risks in current and future conditions. In this paper, we propose a framework for global flood risk assessment for river floods, which can be applied in current conditions, as well as in future conditions due to climate and socio-economic changes. The framework's goal is to establish flood hazard and impact estimates at a high enough resolution to allow for their combination into a risk estimate. The framework estimates hazard at high resolution ({\textasciitilde}1 km2) using global forcing datasets of the current (or in scenario mode, future) climate, a global hydrological model, a global flood routing model, and importantly, a flood extent downscaling routine. The second component of the framework combines hazard with flood impact models at the same resolution (e.g. damage, affected GDP, and affected population) to establish indicators for flood risk (e.g. annual expected damage, affected GDP, and affected population). The framework has been applied using the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB, which includes an optional global flood routing model DynRout, combined with scenarios from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE). We performed downscaling of the hazard probability distributions to 1 km2 resolution with a new downscaling algorithm, applied on Bangladesh as a first case-study application area. We demonstrate the risk assessment approach in Bangladesh based on GDP per capita data, population, and land use maps for 2010 and 2050. Validation of the hazard and damage estimates has been performed using the Dartmouth Flood Observatory database and damage estimates from the EM-DAT database and World Bank sources. We discuss and show sensitivities of the estimated risks with regard to the use of different climate input sets, decisions made in the downscaling algorithm, and different approaches to establish impact models.},

There are a small number of complex agents, which have an internal structure and are therefore subsystems within society, and a larger number of simple agents. Based on the UK data, the results show that Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs) come to dominate, but only in the very long run (after 2030), while biofuels and ICE (Internal Combustion Engine)-electric hybrids are the main alternatives to the regime in the next 10–30 years, because a) they are already developed and b) they ﬁt better into current infrastructures. The model shows that technological transitions are most likely. Lifestyle change transitions require sustained pressure from the environment on society and behavioural change from consumers.},

Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data.

It emphasises the need for and value of incorporating a broader range of complementary modelling tools and models that illuminate aspects often abstracted in conventional approaches. This would permit to anticipate more adequately the impacts of the environmental crisis, environmental policies and transition strategies, and to assess their economic consequences. The authors discuss the theoretical and operational challenges faced by current models (New Keynesian DSGE and EEE-CGE types) and suggest alternative empirical modelling approaches developed in academic and public institutions. The aim of this work is both to provide an exhaustive review of complementary operational models in collaboration with their research teams, and to prioritise model development and guide discussions towards more effective policy recommendations. By integrating additional and complementary models having comparative advantages in addressing specific policy questions, this paper argues that the inventory of modelling tools of the European Commission could be enhanced. This paper makes a case for a more diversified, holistic and robust approach to economic modelling, to make them more capable of supporting the design of efficient, feasible, fair and socially acceptable ecological transition strategies. It also calls for an institutional convergence and interdisciplinary dialogue between modelling teams to improve tools and to provide effective and systemic guidance to policymakers in the EU.},

	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-04395369},
	abstract = {This thesis builds upon the incipient field of ecological macroeconomics to explore the global systemic risks emerging from the interaction between energy, finance and the economy in a context of intensifying socio-ecological changes.The introduction details how systemic risks have become a feature of modern economies due to the tight interaction between energy-finance-economy systems, the economic instability of financialized capitalism and the immoderate use of fossil fuels. It also critically reviews ecological macroeconomics modeling frameworks before presenting research questions that arise from their limitations, and the approach designed to address those questions.Chapter 1 presents five studies advancing the understanding of biophysical processes of modern economies, i.e. the collection of net energy, the use of materials, and the release of waste. The first article analyzes the extent to which the net-energy supply of oil products is affected by the use of lower quality energy sources, from 1950 to 2050. The second article treats the same research question and with a similar approach but for gas. The third article relies on input−output tables to calculate the energy necessary to produce households and governments’ final consumption, accounting for the energy embodied in the whole value chain--including capital goods, for 49 regions and in the year 2017. The fourth article presents a dynamic model of the global fossil fuels production infrastructures and materials requirements for each segment of the supply chain, as well as the embedded energy and CO2 emissions from 1950 to 2050. The fifth article presents a novel open-access web visualization interface mapping greenhouse gases emissions for 49 regions from 1995 to 2019.Relying on the methods previously developed, Chapter 2 presents two studies dealing with the modeling of biophysical processes in macroeconomic models. The first paper introduces a new ecological, stock-flow consistent macroeconomic model, named TEMPLE, designed to assess the economic consequences of a global energy transition scenario compatible with the 1.5° C target of the Paris Agreement. Our results indicate that achieving this transition will generate dynamics similar to those of a wartime economy, with high inflation, investment and employment rates. Another important finding is that a slowdown in the economy's growth rate reduces inflation and therefore facilitates the transition. The second study is a comment piece federating an important fraction of the net energy analysis community. By making the emerging consensus explicit, the article identifies areas of investigation for the community, discusses the consequences of net energy in the context of the energy transition, and highlights the problems associated with ignoring it. In this sense, it presents a critical assessment of the way in which industrial energy in the energy production sector is taken into account, and how the interactions between energy and the economy are modeled in integrated assessment models (IAM). Finally, it suggests practical ways forward, highlighting the need to integrate an ecological macroeconomics perspective and encourage collaborative efforts between our different research communities.The conclusion summarizes the work carried out during the thesis, calling for a change of paradigm for macroeconomic modeling and an appreciation of the post-growth research field.},

We believe a renewal of macroeconomic thinking and macroeconomic modeling is possible by recognizing that our economies should be analyzed as complex adaptive systems. A coherent and exhaustive representation of the inter-linkages between the real and financial sides of the economy is vital as well. We propose a macroeconomic framework based on a novel combination of the Agent Based and Stock Flow Consistent approaches. This paper presents a benchmark model for this innovative approach. Our model depicts an economy with capital and credit in which different types of agents locally interact on different markets. We provide a detailed representation of individual agents’ balance sheets, ensuring the model accounting consistency at the micro, meso, and macro levels. We analyze the properties of our simulated economy under different configurations of agent heuristics, focusing in particular on the role of credit and investment. We explain in detail the logic followed to calibrate and validate the model. Results show that our benchmark model is able to reproduce many stylized facts observed in real world, thus representing a good starting point to test -- in the next works -- different economic policies and institutional setups. Finally, the relatively simple and flexible structure of the model opens up many possibilities for development of the framework along different lines, thus providing a fertile soil for new applications.},

	abstract = {We introduce the concept of time of emergence of economic impacts (ToEI), which identifies the initial moment when the climate change impact signal exceeds a previously defined threshold of past economic output shocks in a given geographic area. We compute the ToEI using probabilistic climate change projections and impact functions from three integrated assessment models of climate change: DICE, RICE and CLIMRISK. Our results demonstrate that, in terms of the business-as-usual carbon emissions scenario, the global economy could reach its ToEI by 2095. Regional results highlight areas that are likely to reach the ToEI sooner, namely Western Europe by 2075, India by 2083, and Africa by 2085. We also explore local-scale variations in the ToEI demonstrating that, for example, Paris already reached the ToEI around 2020, while Shanghai will reach it around 2080. We conclude that the ToEI methodology can be applied to impact models of varying scales when sufficient historical impact data are available. Moreover, unprecedented impacts of climate change in the 21st century may be experienced even in economically developed regions in the US and Europe. Finally, moderate to stringent climate change mitigation policies could delay the extreme economic impacts of climate change by three decades in Latin America, the Middle East, and Japan, by two decades in India, Western Europe, and the US, and by one decade in Africa. Our results can be used by policymakers interested in implementing timely climate policies to prevent potentially large economic shocks due to climate change.},

	abstract = {Extreme climatic events are likely to become more frequent owing to global warming. This may put additional stress on critical infrastructures with typically long life spans. However, little is known about the risks of multiple climate extremes on critical infrastructures at regional to continental scales. Here we show how single- and multi-hazard damage to energy, transport, industrial, and social critical infrastructures in Europe are likely to develop until the year 2100 under the influence of climate change. We combine a set of high-resolution climate hazard projections, a detailed representation of physical assets in various sectors and their sensitivity to the hazards, and more than 1100 records of losses from climate extremes in a prognostic modelling framework. We find that damages could triple by the 2020s, multiply six-fold by mid-century, and amount to more than 10 times present damage of €3.4 billion per year by the end of the century due only to climate change. Damage from heatwaves, droughts in southern Europe, and coastal floods shows the most dramatic rise, but the risks of inland flooding, windstorms, and forest fires will also increase in Europe, with varying degrees of change across regions. Economic losses are highest for the industry, transport, and energy sectors. Future losses will not be incurred equally across Europe. Southern and south-eastern European countries will be most affected and, as a result, will probably require higher costs of adaptation. The findings of this study could aid in prioritizing regional investments to address the unequal burden of impacts and differences in adaptation capacities across Europe.},

However, financial actors’ reaction to climate finance initiatives, and their implications on decarbonization of the economy and on inequality, has not been assessed yet. Our manuscript contributes to address this knowledge gap by analysing under which conditions government’s climate finance policies and investors’ climate risk adjustment can affect the success of the low-carbon transition and the ability to close the green investment gap. We further develop the EIRIN Stock-Flow Consistent behavioural model with a financial market, an energy market and investors’ portfolio choice of financial contracts, for the European Union. First, we study the macroeconomic impacts of government’s green subsidies that can be financed either by introducing an unanticipated carbon tax or by issuing green sovereign bonds. Then, we assess how investors adjust firms’ risk assessment in reaction to the carbon tax introduction, and how this affects firms’ low-carbon investment decisions. We find that both a carbon tax and green bonds financing can give rise to trade-offs in terms of decarbonization of the economy (absolute emission reductions), distributive effects and public debt sustainability. The channels of transmission differ and are policy and instrument specific. Green subsidies that are financed by green sovereign bonds issuance generate positive spillovers on GDP growth and less distributive effects than a carbon tax. Nevertheless, due to the relative decoupling of the economy, GDP growth impairs emission reduction efforts. Finally, investors’ climate risk adjustment helps to smooth this trade-off, contributing to a full decoupling.},

	abstract = {Shifting our fossil-fuelled civilisation to clean modes of production and consumption requires deep transformations in our energy and economic systems. Innovation in physical technologies and social behaviours is key to this transformation. But innovation has not been at the heart of economic models of climate change. This paper reviews the state of the art on the economics of innovation, applies recent insights to climate change. The core insight is that technological innovation is a path-dependent process in which history and expectations matter greatly in determining eventual outcomes This insight has six important implications for climate policy design. First, efficient climate policy requires direct research subsidies for inducing and/or diffusing clean innovations, combined with carbon pricing (whether by taxes or trading). Second, both public and private sector involvement is required — private market forces need to be mobilised and redirected towards cleaner energy sources by governments. Third, path dependence and system inertia imply that delaying policies that redirect innovation towards clean technologies significantly increases costs in the future. Fourth, more developed countries should act as leaders in clean technology and should subsidise access to such technologies for less developed countries. At the same time, they should consider the possibility of using border carbon adjustments against any country that would take advantage of the new environmental policies by specialising in the production and export of fossil fuel intensive products. Fifth, if a transition from coal to clean energy is to be made via intermediates (for example, gas), the use of gas (without carbon capture) should be agreed to be on a time-limited basis. Further, to avoid gas lock-in, research in fully clean technologies would need to be strongly stepped up over the intervening period, along with other supportive policies. Finally, investment in coal should not be encouraged, as its continued use is only safe if we assume the cost-effectiveness of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. While much greater efforts should be taken to reduce the costs of CCS, the speed that these technologies can be developed and deployed is uncertain.},

	abstract = {Climate change has become a main concern of ministries of finance, central banks, and financial regulators. In response, a suite of scenarios and tools have been developed to assess the financial risks from physical climate shocks (for example, hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, flooding). However, those scenarios do not fully capture such shocks, which could lead financial institutions to underestimate the potential scale of climate risks and underprice investments in resilience. This is particularly important for emerging markets and developing economies where exposure to physical climate risks is already high and is expected to further increase with climate change. The paper identifies five areas, or risk drivers, that make a material contribution to physical climate risks to the financial sector and that are not consistently included in current scenarios and tools: (1) extreme weather events, (2) uncertainties in climate models, (3) compound scenarios, (4) indirect economic impacts of shocks, and (5) feedback between the real economy and the financial sector. We derive a framework for generating scenarios to assess acute physical climate-related financial risks, which is inspired by the “Realistic Disaster Scenarios” that are used in risk management and supervision in the insurance sector. The framework is illustrated through an application of the EIRIN macroeconomic model. This framework aims to complement recent work by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to inform ministries of finance, central banks, financial regulators, and financial institutions on climate financial risk assessments, both for micro- and macroprudential risk management, and to incorporate climate risks into wider financial decision making and disclosures.},

Our ﬁndings are threefold: 1) the +2 °C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the longterm (resp. short-term) results of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to severe economic consequences without the implementation (resp. in case of too rapid an application) of proactive climate policies. Global warming (resp. too fast transition) forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses (resp. to lower carbon emissions), thus endangering ﬁnancial stability; 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5 °C target.},

	abstract = {Here we present an update to the FaIR model for use in probabilistic future climate and scenario exploration, integrated assessment, policy analysis, and education. In this update we have focussed on identifying a minimum level of structural complexity in the model. The result is a set of six equations, five of which correspond to the standard impulse response model used for greenhouse gas (GHG) metric calculations in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, plus one additional physically motivated equation to represent state-dependent feedbacks on the response timescales of each greenhouse gas cycle. This additional equation is necessary to reproduce non-linearities in the carbon cycle apparent in both Earth system models and observations. These six equations are transparent and sufficiently simple that the model is able to be ported into standard tabular data analysis packages, such as Excel, increasing the potential user base considerably. However, we demonstrate that the equations are flexible enough to be tuned to emulate the behaviour of several key processes within more complex models from CMIP6. The model is exceptionally quick to run, making it ideal for integrating large probabilistic ensembles. We apply a constraint based on the current estimates of the global warming trend to a million-member ensemble, using the constrained ensemble to make scenario-dependent projections and infer ranges for properties of the climate system. Through these analyses, we reaffirm that simple climate models (unlike more complex models) are not themselves intrinsically biased “hot” or “cold”: it is the choice of parameters and how those are selected that determines the model response, something that appears to have been misunderstood in the past. This updated FaIR model is able to reproduce the global climate system response to GHG and aerosol emissions with sufficient accuracy to be useful in a wide range of applications and therefore could be used as a lowest-common-denominator model to provide consistency in different contexts. The fact that FaIR can be written down in just six equations greatly aids transparency in such contexts.},

However, some economists and climate scientists have claimed that we need to use some kind of model for policy analysis and that IAMs can be structured and used in ways that correct for their shortcomings. For example, it has been argued that although we know very little about key relationships in the model, we can get around this problem by attaching probability distributions to various parameters and then simulating the model using Monte Carlo methods. I argue that this would buy us nothing and that a simpler and more transparent approach to the design of climate change policy is preferable.

First, by tailoring the EIRIN Stock-Flow Consistent behavioural model, we provide a dynamic balance sheet assessment of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) scenarios. We find that an orderly transition achieves early co-benefits by reducing CO2 emissions (12\% less in 2040 than in 2020) while supporting growth in economic output. In contrast, a disorderly transition worsens the economic performance and financial stability of the euro area. Further, in a disorderly transition with higher physical risks, real GDP decreases by 12.5\% in 2050 relative to an orderly transition. Second, we analyse how firms’ expectations about climate policy credibility (climate sentiments) affect investment decisions in high or low-carbon goods. Firms that trust an orderly policy introduction do anticipate the carbon tax and switch earlier to low-carbon investments. This, in turn, accelerates economic decarbonization and decreases the risk of carbon-stranded assets for investors. Our results highlight the crucial role of early and credible climate policies to signal investment decisions in the low-carbon transition.},

	abstract = {Fiscal and monetary policies, as well as new financial instruments, could play a key role to meet the Paris Agreement. However, deep uncertainty characterizes their design and their potential effects on growth, financial and credit market stability, and inequality. We develop the EIRIN flow-of-funds behavioural model to simulate the introduction of green fiscal policies and green sovereign bonds, and we display their effects on firms' investments in the brown and green sector, on unemployment, on the credit and bonds market. EIRIN is Stock-Flow Consistent and is rooted on a balance sheet approach. It adopts a Leontief production function with no substitution of the production factors, i.e., Labour, Capital, and Raw Materials. Its sectors are endowed with adaptive behaviours and expectations, and interact with the others and the foreign sector through a set of markets. Simulations show that green public policies can promote green growth by influencing firms’ expectations and the credit market. Green sovereign bonds represent a short-term win-win solution, while green fiscal measures have higher immediate distributive effects that induce negative feedbacks on the economy. These results are influenced by the conditions (fiscal, budgetary and public debt/GDP) in which both measures are implemented.},

In this paper, the authors discuss a series of results, assessing the materiality of climate risks for economic and financial stability and alternative policy pathways by means of the Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes (DSK) agent-based integrated-assessment model. Their results suggest that the emergence of tipping points due to unmitigated physical risks will reduce long-run growth and spur financial and economic instability. Moreover, diverse types of climate shocks have a different impact on economic dynamics and on the chances of observing a transition to carbonless growth. While these results call for immediate and ambitious interventions, appropriate mitigation policies need to be designed. The authors’ results show that carbon taxation is not the most suitable tool to achieve zero-emission growth, given its serious transition costs. On the contrary, command-and-control regulation and innovation policies to foster green investments are the key elements of the most promising policy mix to put the economy on a green growth pathway. Overall, their results contradict the standard tenets of cost–benefit climate economics and suggest the absence of any trade-off between decarbonization and growth.},

The model comprises heterogeneous fossil-fuel and renewable plants, capital- and consumption-good firms and a climate box linking greenhouse gasses emission to temperature dynamics and microeconomic climate shocks affecting labour productivity and energy demand of firms. Simulation results show that the economy possesses two statistical equilibria: a carbon-intensive lock-in and a sustainable growth path characterized by better macroeconomic performances. Once climate damages are accounted for, the likelihood of a green transition depends on the damage function employed. While energy efficiency shocks (which raise the demand of energy) exert little effects on the macroeconomic performance compared to labour productivity impacts, they disproportionally harm the chances of an energy transition by exacerbating path-dependence in the process of technical change in favour of fossil-fuel technologies. Finally, we run a series of policy experiments on carbon (fossil fuel) taxes and green subsidies. We find that the effectiveness of such market-based instruments is limited, though it also depends upon the different channels climate change affects the economy through. Complementary policies might be required to avoid carbon-intensive lock-ins.},

	abstract = {Which policies can increase the resilience of the financial system to climate risks? Recent evidence on the significant impacts of climate change and natural disasters on firms, banks and other financial institutions call for a prompt policy response. In this paper, we employ a macro-financial agent-based model to study the interaction between climate change, credit and economic dynamics and test a mix of policy interventions. We first show that financial constraints exacerbate the impact of climate shocks on the economy while, at the same time, climate damages to firms make the banking sector more prone to crises. We find that credit provision can both increase firms’ productivity and their financial fragility, with such a trade-off being exacerbated by the effects of climate change. We then test a set of “green” finance policies addressing these risks, while fostering climate change mitigation: i) green Basel-type capital requirements, ii) green public guarantees to credit, and iii) carbon-risk adjustment in credit ratings. All the policies reduce carbon emissions and the resulting climate impacts, though moderately. However, their effects on financial and real dynamics is not straightforwardly positive. Some combinations of policies fuel credit booms, exacerbating financial instability and increasing public debt. We show that the combination of the three policies leads to a virtuous cycle of (mild) emission reductions, stable financial sector and high economic growth. Additional tools would be needed to fully adapt to climate change. Hence, our results point to the need to complement financial policies cooling down climate-related risks with mitigation policies curbing emissions from real economic activities.},

Although historical records indicate that economic shocks might lead to financial instability, few studies have focused on the impact of climate change on the financial actors5,6. This paper examines how climate-related damages impact the stability of the global banking system. We use an agent-based climate–macroeconomic model calibrated on stylized facts, future scenarios and climate impact functions7 affecting labour and capital. Our results indicate that climate change will increase the frequency of banking crises (26–248\%). Rescuing insolvent banks will cause an additional fiscal burden of approximately 5–15\% of gross domestic product per year and increase the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product by a factor of 2. We estimate that around 20\% of such effects are caused by the deterioration of banks’ balance sheets induced by climate change. Macroprudential regulation attenuates bailout costs, but only moderately. Our results show that leaving the financial system out of climate–economy integrated assessment may lead to an underestimation of climate impacts and that financial regulation can play a role in mitigating them.},

Our simulation analysis sheds light on the (direct and indirect) channels by which the use of different fiscal policy tools can affect the UK economy and emissions, and illustrates that the effects can be very different depending on how green fiscal policy tools are exactly designed and implemented.},

The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016–2120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields.},

We show that (i) carbon taxes reduce global warming but increase financial risks due to their adverse effects on the profitability of firms and credit availability; (ii) green subsidies and green public investment improve ecological efficiency, but their positive environmental impact is partially offset by their macroeconomic rebound effects; and (iii) a green fiscal policy mix derives better outcomes than isolated policies.

We identify the transmission channels by which these green differentiated capital requirements (GDCRs) can affect credit provision and loan spreads, and we analyse these channels within a dynamic framework in which climate and macrofinancial feedback effects play a key role. Our main findings are as follows. First, GDCRs can reduce the pace of global warming and decrease thereby the physical financial risks. This reduction is quantitatively small, but is enhanced when the GSF and the DPF are implemented simultaneously or in combination with green fiscal policies. Second, the DPF reduces banks’ credit provision and leverage, making them less fragile. Third, both the DPF and the GSF generate some transition risks: the GSF increases bank leverage because it boosts green credit and the DPF increases loan defaults since it reduces economic activity. These effects are small in quantitative terms and are attenuated when there is a simultaneous implementation of the DPF and the GSF. Fourth, fiscal policies that boost green investment amplify the transition risks of the GSF and reduce the transition risks of the DPF; the combination of green fiscal policy with the DPF is thereby a potentially effective climate policy mix from a financial stability point of view.},

For such policies, the issue of endogenous technological change becomes important, both to estimate the overall costs and to identify the intertemporally cost-effective combination of mitigation options. In this paper, we first discuss the recent literature that evaluates the potential for endogenous technological change to reduce mitigation costs, and the efforts to incorporate endogenous technological change into pre-existing integrated assessment models. Then we formulate our own integrated assessment model, the Model of INvestment and Technological Development (MIND), which allows analysis of the relationship between specific mitigation options and the costs of ambitious climate protection objectives. Our model reveals two important results. First, the incorporation of technological change in a portfolio of mitigation options can reduce the costs of climate policies substantially. Achieving the ambitious policy goals necessary to avoid dangerous climate change becomes feasible without significant welfare losses. Second, the different mitigation options are of different importance in achieving climate protection goals: improving energy efficiency becomes too costly as a major mitigation option in the long run. In the long run, fossil fuels have to be substituted by renewable energy sources because a backstop technology with the potential of learning-by-doing has the strongest impact on reducing the welfare losses due to climate protection. Furthermore, Carbon Capturing and Sequestration can allow for further reduction in the costs of climate protection and can postpone the need to transform the energy system from a fossil-fuelbased one to a renewables one.},

Progress requires a careful understanding of the chain of physical changes—global and regional temperature, precipitation, ocean acidification, polar ice melting. We relate those changes to other physical and biological variables that help people understand risks to factors relevant to their daily lives—crop yield, food prices, premature death, flooding or drought events, land use change. Finally, we investigate how societies may adapt, or not, to these changes and how the combination of measures to adapt or to live with losses will affect the economy. Valuation and assessment of market impacts can play an important role, but we must recognize the limits of efforts to value impacts where deep uncertainty does not allow a description of the causal chain of effects that can be described, much less assigned a likelihood. A mixed approach of valuing impacts, evaluating physical and biological effects, and working to better describe uncertainties in the earth system can contribute to the social dialogue needed to achieve consensus on the level and type of mitigation and adaptation actions.},

	abstract = {In this study, we develop a new integrated assessment model called the BET model (Basic Energy systems, Economy, Environment, and End-use Technology Model). It is a multiregional, global model based on Ramsey’s optimal growth theory and includes not only traditional end-use technologies but also advanced end-use technologies such as heat-pump water heaters and electric vehicles. Using the BET model, we conduct simulations and obtain the following results. (1) Advanced end-use technologies have an important role in containing carbon prices as well as GDP losses when GHG (greenhouse gas) constraints are stringent. (2) Electrification based on energy services progresses rapidly in scenarios with stringent GHG constraints. This is because electricity can be supplied by various methods of non-fossil power generation, and advanced end-use technologies can drastically improve energy-to-service efficiencies. The BET’s results indicate the importance of analyses that systematically combine environmental constraints, end-use technologies, supply energy technologies, and economic development.},

	abstract = {Integrated Assessment Models of global climate change (IAMs) are an established tool to study interlinkages between the human and the natural system. Insights from these complex models are widely used to advise policy-makers and to inform the general public. But up to now there has been little understanding of how these models can be evaluated and community-wide standards are missing. To answer this urgent question is a challenge because the systems are open and their future behavior is fundamentally unknown. In this paper, we discuss ways to overcome these problems. Reﬂecting on experience from other modeling communities, we develop an evaluation framework for IAM of global climate change. It builds on a systematic and transparent step-by-step demonstration of a model’s usefulness testing the plausibility of its behavior. Steps in the evaluation hierarchy are: setting up an evaluation framework, evaluation of the conceptual model, code veriﬁcation and documentation, model evaluation, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, documentation of the evaluation process, and communication with stakeholders. An important element in evaluating IAM of global climate change is the use of stylized behavior patterns derived from historical observation. The discussion of two examples is offered in this paper.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a macroeconomic model of endogenous growth that enables us to take into consideration both the economic impact of climate change and the pivotal role of private debt. Using the Goodwin-Keen approach [25], based on the Lotka-Volterra logic, we couple its nonlinear dynamics with abatement costs. Moreover, various damage functions `a la Nordhaus ([38]) and Dietz-Stern ([6]) reﬂect the loss in ﬁnal production due to the temperature increase caused by the rising levels of CO2 emissions. An empirical estimation of the model at the worldscale enables us to simulate plausible trajectories for the planetary business-as-usual scenario. Our main ﬁnding is that, even though the short-run impact of climate change on static economic fundamentals may seem prima facie rather minor, its long-run dynamic consequences may lead to an extreme downside. Under plausible circumstances, global warming forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output losses; the private debt overhang may eventually induce a global ﬁnancial collapse, even before climate change could cause serious damage to the production sector. Under more severe conditions, the interplay between global warming and debt may lead to a secular stagnation followed by a collapse in the second half of this century. We analyze the extent to which slower demographic growth or higher carbon pricing allow a global breakdown to be avoided. The paper concludes by examining the conditions under which the +1.5◦C target, adopted by the Paris Agreement (2015), could be reached.},

	abstract = {Recent global economic and environmental forecasts consistently show a trend of continuous decline in natural resources, degradation of environmental quality, increasing vulnerability of economic growth as a result of environmental stress, competition for land and natural resources, soaring energy prices and climate change. These forecasts partly rest on significant efforts by the scientific community over the past three decades to improve knowledge of the interactions between economic growth and the environment; particularly modelling methods have developed to become increasingly applied to the assessment of the environmental and economic consequences of various energy demand and greenhouse gas policies. However, the significantly diverging viewpoints of models developed by energy engineers, or ‘bottom-up’ (BU) models, and those developed by economists, or ‘top-down’ (TD) models, hinder effective dialogue and mutual understanding between researchers from different academic backgrounds. The purpose of this paper is to promote a constructive dialogue between modellers from each side of the modelling paradigms, based on a comparative critique of the BU TIAM-FR model and the TD IMACLIM-R model. The comparison terms extend from the theoretical foundations of each model to their structure and specifications, and applicability to policy assessment. Preliminary numerical simulations are developed to demonstrate the relevance of linking the two models, while the technical challenges and methodological limitations of coupled simulations are addressed.},

The current report from the Annex XII project is final edition of the preliminary edition Risø-R-1774, which was published in March 2011.
The use of the ETSAP tools is linked to many other projects focusing on model application worldwide. This includes the organisations and institutions gathering in the annual International Energy Workshops (IEW), which are held back-to-back with one of the ETSAP semi-annual workshops.

We develop the EIRIN flow-of-funds behavioural model to simulate the introduction of green fiscal policies and green sovereign bonds, and we display their effects on firms' investments in the brown and green sector, on unemployment, on the credit and bonds market. EIRIN is Stock-Flow Consistent and is rooted on a balance sheet approach. It adopts a Leontief production function with no substitution of the production factors, i.e., Labour, Capital, and Raw Materials. Its sectors are endowed with adaptive behaviours and expectations, and interact with the others and the foreign sector through a set of markets. Simulations show that green public policies can promote green growth by influencing firms’ expectations and the credit market. Green sovereign bonds represent a short-term win-win solution, while green fiscal measures have higher immediate distributive effects that induce negative feedbacks on the economy. These results are influenced by the conditions (fiscal, budgetary and public debt/GDP) in which both measures are implemented.},

We identify the transmission channels by which these green differentiated capital requirements (GDCRs) can affect credit provision and loan spreads, and we analyse these channels within a dynamic framework in which climate and macrofinancial feedback effects play a key role. Our main findings are as follows. First, GDCRs can reduce the pace of global warming and decrease thereby the physical financial risks. This reduction is quantitatively small, but is enhanced when the GSF and the DPF are implemented simultaneously or in combination with green fiscal policies. Second, the DPF reduces banks’ credit provision and leverage, making them less fragile. Third, both the DPF and the GSF generate some transition risks: the GSF increases bank leverage because it boosts green credit and the DPF increases loan defaults since it reduces economic activity. These effects are small in quantitative terms and are attenuated when there is a simultaneous implementation of the DPF and the GSF. Fourth, fiscal policies that boost green investment amplify the transition risks of the GSF and reduce the transition risks of the DPF; the combination of green fiscal policy with the DPF is thereby a potentially effective climate policy mix from a financial stability point of view.},

Transformation of the world towards sustainability in line with the 2030 Agenda requires progress on multiple dimensions of human well-being. We track development of relevant indicators for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1–7 against gross domestic product (GDP) per person in seven world regions and the world as a whole. Across the regions, we find uniform development patterns where SDGs 1–7 – and therefore main human needs – are achieved at around US\$15,000 measured in 2011 US\$ purchasing power parity (PPP).

Technical summary
How does GDP per person relate to the achievement of well-being as targeted by the 2030 Agenda? The 2030 Agenda includes global ambitions to meet human needs and aspirations. However, these need to be met within planetary boundaries. In nascent world-earth modelling, human well-being as well as global environmental impacts are linked through economic production, which is tracked by GDP. We examined historic developments on 5-year intervals, 1980–2015, between average income and the advancement on indicators of SDGs 1–7. This was done for both seven world regions and the world as a whole. We find uniform patterns of saturation for all regions above an income threshold somewhere around US\$15,000 measured in 2011 US\$ PPP. At this level, main human needs and capabilities are met. The level is also consistent with studies of life satisfaction and the Easterlin paradox. We observe stark differences with respect to scale: the patterns of the world as an aggregated whole develop differently from all its seven regions, with implications for world-earth model construction – and sustainability transformations.

Social media summary
Reaching human well-being \#SDGs takes GDP levels of \$15k. This may help shape transformation to a world that respects \#PlanetaryBoundaries.},

Traditional methods of innovation system analysis that mainly focus on the structure of innovation systems have proven to be insufficient. Therefore, we propose a framework that focuses on a number of processes that are highly important for well performing innovation systems. These processes are labeled as ‘functions of innovation systems’. After explaining this framework and embedding it in existing literature, we propose a method for systematically mapping those processes taking place in innovation systems and resulting in technological change. This method can be characterized as a process analysis or history event analysis. Clarifying examples are taken from the empirical field of Sustainable Technology Development.},

              The most important single economic concept in the economics of climate change is the social cost of carbon (SCC). At present, regulations with more than \$1 trillion of benefits have been written for the United States that use the SCC in their economic analysis. The DICE model (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) is one of three integrated assessment models used to estimate the SCC in the United States. The present study presents updated estimates based on a revised DICE model (DICE-2016R). The study estimates that the SCC is \$31 per ton of CO
              2
              in 2010 US\$ for the current period (2015). This study will be an important step in developing the next generation of estimates of the SCC in the United States and other countries.

              The social cost of carbon (SCC) is a central concept for understanding and implementing climate change policies. This term represents the economic cost caused by an additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions or its equivalent. The present study presents updated estimates based on a revised DICE model (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy). The study estimates that the SCC is \$31 per ton of CO
              2
              in 2010 US\$ for the current period (2015). For the central case, the real SCC grows at 3\% per year over the period to 2050. The paper also compares the estimates with those from other sources.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400–1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2°C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

In this paper, we provide a systematic review of ecological macroeconomic models that are suitable for the investigation of low-carbon energy transitions and assess them based on the features considered desirable for a new approach in economics. We draw two main conclusions: firstly, the knowledge base and structure of these existing ecological macroeconomic models are relevant, alongside other types of models, for the creation of a new approach in economics. Secondly, the reviewed models are policy relevant, especially in the context of the complexity and urgency of rapid energy transitions, where increasingly policymakers require economic models able to capture real-world characteristics. However, further improvements are needed to these models and future research should focus on i) assuring comparability of models' results and their policy insights, ii) incorporation of the relationships between macroeconomics, finance and sustainability and iii) the institutionalization of a new approach in economics.},

Hence there is a need for macroeconomic tools that can help identify socially sustainable post-growth pathways. The emerging ﬁeld of ecological macroeconomics aims to address this need and features a number of new macroeconomic modelling approaches. This article provides (1) a review of modelling developments in ecological macroeconomics, based on the literature and interviews with researchers, and (2) an analysis of how the different models incorporate policy themes from the post-growth literature. Twenty-two ecological macroeconomic models were analysed and compared to eight policy themes. It was found that environmental interactions and the monetary system were treated most comprehensively. Themes of income inequality, work patterns, indicators of well-being, and disaggregated production were addressed with less detail, while alternative business models and cross-scale interactions were hardly addressed. Overall, the combination of input-output analysis with stock-ﬂow consistent modelling was identiﬁed as a promising avenue for developing macroeconomic models for a post-growth economy. However, due to the wide interpretation of what “the economy” entails, future research will beneﬁt from employing a range of approaches.},

This paper practices ‘appreciative theory’ [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Bellknap Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982] and brings together insights from evolutionary economics and technology studies. This results in a multi-level perspective on TT where two views of the evolution are combined: (i) evolution as a process of variation, selection and retention, (ii) evolution as a process of unfolding and reconfiguration. The perspective is empirically illustrated with a qualitative longitudinal case-study, the transition from sailing ships to steamships, 1780–1900. Three particular mechanisms in TT are described: niche-cumulation, technological add-on and hybridisation, riding along with market growth.},

            Energy models are used to study emissions mitigation pathways, such as those compatible with the Paris Agreement goals. These models vary in structure, objectives, parameterization and level of detail, yielding differences in the computed energy and climate policy scenarios. To study model differences, diagnostic indicators are common practice in many academic fields, for example, in the physical climate sciences. However, they have not yet been applied systematically in mitigation literature, beyond addressing individual model dimensions. Here we address this gap by quantifying energy model typology along five dimensions: responsiveness, mitigation strategies, energy supply, energy demand and mitigation costs and effort, each expressed through several diagnostic indicators. The framework is applied to a diagnostic experiment with eight energy models in which we explore ten scenarios focusing on Europe. Comparing indicators to the ensemble yields comprehensive ‘energy model fingerprints’, which describe systematic model behaviour and contextualize model differences for future multi-model comparison studies.},

	abstract = {The quantitative functions for climate damages provide theoretical ground for the cost-benefit analysis in climate change economics, and they are also critical for linking climate module with economic module in the Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). Nevertheless, it is necessary for IAMs to update sectoral climate impacts in order to catch up the advance in climate change studies. This study updates the sectoral climate damage function at global scale from climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution (FUND) model and develops the aggregate climate damage function in a bottom-up fashion. Besides conventional sectors such as agriculture, forestry, water resources, energy consumption and ecosystems, this study expands climate disaster types, assesses human health impacts caused by various air pollutants, and updates coastal damage by sea level rise. The Beijing Climate Center Simple Earth System Model (BCC\_SESM) is used to project climate system based on Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario, and the 2 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios based on RCPs and SSP2 databases. Sectoral results show that the agricultural sector is projected to suffer 63\% of the total damage, followed by water resources (16\%) and human health (12\%) sectors in 2100. The regression results indicate that the aggregate climate damage function is in positive quadratic form for zero discounting. Under BAU scenario, the aggregate climate damage is projected to be 517.7 trillion USD during 2011–2100. Compared to that, the 2 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios are projected to respectively reduce climate damages by 215.6 trillion USD (approximately 41.6\%) and 263.5 trillion USD (50.9\%) in 2011–2100.},

	abstract = {Economic modelling plays a major role in the development, justification and evaluation of energy policies. However, there has been little investigation of how political dynamics systematically influence these models’ development and outputs, or the implications for energy strategies, targets and interventions. Using in-depth interviews with 24 European modellers and policyworkers, we illuminate the politics of economic modelling within European Union (EU) energy policymaking, focusing on dynamics of contestation, differentiated influence and power relations within models’ a) framing of questions and problems; b) framing of scenarios and solutions; c) structural assumptions and d) definition of quantitative data inputs. We then consider deeper questions of e) access and exclusion, showing how modelling is used to silence critical voices and reinforce incumbent interests. We argue that understanding this politics of modelling is crucial to the implementation of sustainable energy transitions. We conclude with recommendations for researchers and policyworkers seeking to promote the use of alternative/innovative models in energy policy (within and beyond the EU), centring on reflexivity; recognition; and relationship-building. Developing multi-sectoral ‘communities of practice’ around innovative modelling approaches is vital in challenging a vicious circle of evidence and policy that legitimises business-as-usual in a dangerously warming world.},

	title = {The political economy of degrowth},
	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-02499463},
	abstract = {What is degrowth and what are its implications for political economy? Divided in three parts, this dissertation explores the why, what, and how of degrowth. The first part (Of growth and limits) studies the nature, causes, and consequences of economic growth. Chapter 1: Understanding economic growth answers a series of questions about the nature of economic growth: What is it exactly that grows? By how much does it grow? When and where does it grow? How does it grow? And why should it grow? The three following chapters develop a triple objection to economic growth as no longer possible (Chapter 2: Biophysical limits to growth), plausible (Chapter 3: Socioeconomic limits to growth), and desirable (Chapter 4: Social limits of growth). The second part (Elements of degrowth) is about the idea of degrowth, especially its history, theoretical foundations, and controversies. Chapter 5: Origins and definitions traces the history of the concept from 1968 to 2018. Chapter 6: Theoretical foundations presents a normative theory of degrowth as de-economisation, that is a reduction in importance of economic thoughts and practices. Chapter 7: Controversies reviews the attacks the concept has received. Whereas the first part diagnosed economic growth as the problem, this part offers a solution. The take-home message is that degrowth is not only a critique but also a fully-fledged alternative to the growth society. The third part (Recipes for degrowth) is about the transition from a growth economy to a degrowth society. It opens with an inventory of the policies that have been mobilised by degrowthers until today (Chapter 8: Strategies for change). The three following chapters on property (Chapter 9: Transforming property), work (Chapter 10: Transforming work), and money (Chapter 11: Transforming money) go from theory to practice and translate the values and principles of degrowth into operational transition strategies. Chapter 12: Transition strategy presents a method to study the interactions between degrowth policies in order to craft effective transition strategies. The central claim of this final part is that degrowth is a powerful conceptual tool to think about societal transformations for social-ecological justice.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether a capitalist economy can ever sustain a ‘stationary’ (or nongrowing) state, or whether, as often claimed, capitalism has an inherent ‘growth imperative’ arising from the charging of interest on debt. We outline the development of a dedicated system dynamics macro-economic model for describing Financial Assets and Liabilities in a Stock-Flow consistent Framework (FALSTAFF) and use this model to explore the potential for stationary state outcomes in an economy with balanced trade, credit creation by banks, and private equity. Contrary to claims in the literature, we ﬁnd that neither credit creation nor the charging of interest on debt creates a ‘growth imperative’ in and of themselves. This ﬁnding remains true even when capital adequacy and liquidity requirements are imposed on banks. We test the robustness of our results in the face of random variations and one-off shocks. We show further that it is possible to move from a growth path towards a stationary state without either crashing the economy or dismantling the system. Nonetheless, there remain several good reasons to support the reform of the monetary system. Our model also supports critiques of austerity and underlines the value of countercyclical spending by government.},

	abstract = {People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of the participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.

We first document that several studies estimate large positive long-run impacts, but that relatively few existing RCTs have been evaluated over the long run. We next present evidence from a systematic survey of existing RCTs, with a focus on cash transfer and child health programs, and show that a meaningful subset can realistically be evaluated for long-run effects. We discuss ways to bridge the gap between the burgeoning number of development RCTs and the limited number that have been followed up to date, including through new panel (longitudinal) data; improved participant tracking methods; alternative research designs; and access to administrative, remote sensing, and cell phone data. We conclude that the rise of development economics RCTs since roughly 2000 provides a novel opportunity to generate high-quality evidence on the long-run drivers of living standards.},

              The hypothesis that education enhances economic decision-making has been surprisingly underexplored. Kim
              et al.
              studied this question using a randomized control trial in a sample of 2812 girls in secondary schools in Malawi. Four years after providing financial support for a year's schooling, they presented the subjects with a set of decision problems (for example, allocating funds to immediate versus future expenses) that test economic rationality. The education intervention enhanced both educational outcomes and economic rationality as measured by consistency with utility maximization in the long run.

            An experiment with secondary school students shows that education enhances economic rationality measured with decision problems.
          , 
            Schooling rewards people with labor market returns and nonpecuniary benefits in other realms of life. However, there is no experimental evidence showing that education interventions improve individual economic rationality. We examine this hypothesis by studying a randomized 1-year financial support program for education in Malawi that reduced absence and dropout rates and increased scores on a qualification exam of female secondary school students. We measure economic rationality 4 years after the intervention by using lab-in-the-field experiments to create scores of consistency with utility maximization that are derived from revealed preference theory. We find that students assigned to the intervention had higher scores of rationality. The results remain robust after controlling for changes in cognitive and noncognitive skills. Our results suggest that education enhances the quality of economic decision-making.},

              OER
              ) by educators, formal learners and informal learners across the globe. These data focus on the overall picture emerging from the survey research of the project, which presently comprises more than 6390 responses, 50.3\% of which are informal learners, 24.7\% of which are formal learners, 21.6\% of which are educators and 3.4\% of which are librarians.

It provides rationales as to why CCE should be addressed in the context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD).

	abstract = {This article makes the case for the education sector an untapped opportunity to combat climate change. It sets forth a definition of Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development that is comprehensive and multidisciplinary and asserts that it must not only include relevant content knowledge on climate change, environmental and social issues, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable consumption and lifestyles, but also a focus on the institutional environment in which that content is learned to ensure that schools and education systems themselves are climate-proofed and resilient as well as sustainable and green. The article presents evidence-based findings on the factors that influence skills, attitude and behaviour change the most, in order to determine what works for formal and non-formal climate change education content, including environmental education, climate change and scientific literacy, and education for sustainable lifestyles and consumption. The evidence shows that educational interventions are most successful when they focus on local, tangible, and actionable aspects of sustainable development, climate change and environmental education, especially those that can be addressed by individual behaviour. Finally, given that the majority of evidence that exists is anecdotal, often in case study format without monitoring and evaluation processes in place that could lead to quantitative as well as qualitative data, the article highlights remaining questions and areas of research that need to be investigated in order to guide effective climate change education policy and practice.},

Addressing child health and providing information on how earnings rise with education can increase schooling even more cost-effectively. However, among those in school, test scores are remarkably low and unresponsive to more-of-the-same inputs, such as hiring additional teachers, buying more textbooks, or providing flexible grants. In contrast, pedagogical reforms that match teaching to students’ learning levels are highly cost effective at increasing learning, as are reforms that improve accountability and incentives, such as local hiring of teachers on short-term contracts. Technology could potentially improve pedagogy and accountability. Improving pre- and postprimary education are major future challenges.},

This is because economists made their own predictions of damages, using three spurious methods: assuming that about 90\% of GDP will be unaﬀected by climate change, because it happens indoors; using the relationship between temperature and GDP today as a proxy for the impact of global warming over time; and using surveys that diluted extreme warnings from scientists with optimistic expectations from economists. Nordhaus has misrepresented the scientiﬁc literature to justify the using a smooth function to describe the damage to GDP from climate change. Correcting for these errors makes it feasible that the economic damages from climate change are at least an order of magnitude worse than forecast by economists, and may be so great as to threaten the survival of human civilization.},

In these new damage functions, which can be applied to the regional and global scales, adaptation to a changing climate is introduced by allowing the reference climate to be a function of time instead of a fixed quantity. Different formulations of damage functions discussed in the literature arise as special cases.},

The research side of the project included three work streams: Analysis of past coal and industrial transitions Case studies on pathways to implement coal transitions compatible with the “well below 2°C” objective in six major coal-using economies, i.e. China, India, South Africa, Poland, Germany, and Australia Analysis of the impacts of coal transitions on the global coal trade The national case studies cited in this report were developed by national experts on the coal sector, as well as on energy systems, labour markets and industrial policy in the respective countries. The case studies aim to suggest concrete options for implementing national coal transitions that are consistent with the “well below 2°C” aim of the Paris Agreement, while being fair and just, and respecting national differences. However, they are not necessarily compatible with the Paris Agreement aspirational goal to limit temperature increases to 1.5°C. Further information on the methodology used for the research can be found in the introduction to the report and in the specific reports this study draws from.},

La décomposition de l’indice de Gini en sous-groupes effectuée montre que les inégalités interrégionales ont augmenté. En outre, les résultats économétriques suggèrent qu’une augmentation de 1\% des revenus pétroliers contribue à augmenter les inégalités de 0,09\%. Cette augmentation des inégalités est d’autant plus importante que la répartition des revenus pétroliers coïncide avec des considérations d’ordre politique.

	abstract = {Mortality rates in the United States fell more rapidly during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries than in any other period in American history. This decline coincided with an epidemiological transition and the disappearance of a mortality “penalty” associated with living in urban areas. There is little empirical evidence and much unresolved debate about what caused these improvements, however. In this article, we report the causal influence of clean water technologies— filtration and chlorination—on mortality in major cities during the early twentieth century. Plausibly exogenous variation in the timing and location of technology adoption was used to identify these effects, and the validity of this identifying assumption is examined in detail. We found that clean water was responsible for nearly half the total mortality reduction in major cities, three quarters of the infant mortality reduction, and nearly two thirds of the child mortality reduction. Rough calculations suggest that the social rate of return to these technologies was greater than 23 to 1, with a cost per person-year saved by clean water of about \$500 in 2003 dollars. Implications for developing countries are briefly considered.},

	abstract = {During the 2008 global economic crisis Sovereign Wealth Funds [SWFs] (state owned investment vehicles that invest in the global financial markets for the benefit of the sponsoring government) saved Wall Street, the centre of global finance, from the brink of collapse. These state-owned investment vehicles injected fresh capital to bail out failing financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley as well as collapsing equity markets. Since then, SWFs have become a dominant feature of the global economy. In an effort to avert negative effects of the natural resource curse such as commodity price volatility more and more African governments are turning to commodity-based SWFs. However, many of these efforts are premature. Many African governments are establishing commodity-based SWFs without taking into cognisance factors that enable the successful operationalisation of this institution (i.e., a prudent natural resource revenue management framework, robust macroeconomic policies and a sound governance framework). Consequently, many SWFs on the African continent are premature funds. The primary objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it explains how, when and why commodity-based SWFs should be established in Africa. Secondly, it explains how this institution should be governed.},

	abstract = {Ce numéro est construit autour d’un dossier « Afrique centrale », région confrontée depuis une décennie à une crise profonde et caractérisée par des dynamiques transfrontalières de conflits. 

Différents signaux positifs, dont la récente réussite du processus électoral au Burundi, permettent aujourd’hui d’espérer que la région est sortie de la phase principalement militaire de la crise et qu’elle entre dans ce pas de temps particulièrement délicat, entre fin de guerre et construction de la paix. Le moment paraît donc opportun de dépasser les questions exclusivement militaires et politiques et d’explorer quelques-unes des recompositions sociales, économiques et culturelles sous-jacentes dont les fondements sont non seulement anciens mais présentent bien souvent aussi des configurations communes à tous les pays de la région, voire transnationales.

Ce dossier comporte également trois articles qui nourrissent ce nécessaire éclairage croisé sur quelques-unes des problématiques du développement : la pratique d’une démocratie formelle au Malawi, le processus de décentralisation au Mali et ses dimensions économiques et sociales et, enfin, le difficile problème de la sortie des économies de guerre, illustré ici par une analyse de la filière « opium » en Afghanistan.

	title = {Factors impeding the operationalisation of {Zimbabwe}'s commodity-based {Sovereign} {Wealth} {Fund}},
	abstract = {Over the past decade, many natural resource-rich developing economies have deployed commodity-based Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) to manage their natural resource revenues. However, many of these efforts were premature. Establishing a commoditybased SWF only makes sense in a country that possesses robust mechanisms for capturing and accounting for resource rents and a budgetary framework that channels those rents to broad-based and inclusive social and economic development. In 2009, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) encouraged the government of Zimbabwe to establish an SWF to ameliorate challenges associated with the natural resource curse. However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advised the government of Zimbabwe to re-examine the fiscal regime of its extractive industries before launching its SWF. Zimbabwe’s extractive industries are captured by a comprador securocrat bourgeoisie that feels entitled to rule and loot the country in perpetuity. Consequently, very little natural resource revenue is deposited in government coffers. Contrary to the advice of the IMF, the government of Zimbabwe rushed to establish an SWF before it had reexamined the fiscal regime of its extractive industries. Resultantly, Zimbabwe’s SWF is a premature fund. Existing literature defines what premature funds are. However, it does not go onto explain why some governments rush to establish SWFs before acquiring the prerequisite conditions required to successfully operationalise one. Using Zimbabwe as a case study example, this qualitative study explains why some governments prematurely establish SWFs. Data were collected using elite interviews and unobstructive methods. Moreover, data were presented using thematic and qualitative content analysis. Research findings reveal that the government of Zimbabwe rushed to establish an SWF because of the fear of being the odd one out among its structural equivalents, it felt obliged to implement the recommendations of its biggest development partner the UNDP, it needed to look modern and sophisticated through finance and it also needed to widen its patronage turf. Moreover, research findings also reveal that the design of Zimbabwe’s SWF as a financial institution is not designed in such a way to make it an effective investment fund, as compared with global standards of investment management. The study recommends that the government of Zimbabwe needs to re-examine the fiscal regime of its extractive industry and the governance architecture of its SWF before it can successfully operationalise its SWF.},

	abstract = {Addressing sustainability challenges requires fundamental transformations in electricity, heat, mobility, and agri-food systems. To do so, research and policy efforts tend to emphasise the importance of fostering new, more sustainable systems through innovation. Instead, this paper focuses explicitly on the “flipside” of innovation: The fate of established systems faced with their potential destabilisation and decline. It is argued that any transition in consumption-production systems involves a combination of innovation (something new emerges) and destabilisation (something old is being challenged). To examine the role of destabilisation, decline, and phase-out for policy and practice efforts, this paper advances conceptual and empirical contributions. Conceptually, it elaborates a framework based on three interacting destabilisation mechanisms: The build-up of pressures, strategic responses by central system actors, and changing commitments to reproductive activities. Empirically, it draws on the historic dismantling of electric tramways in France. The decline of the tramway in France followed a gradual erosion pattern resulting from the long-term degradation of technical, political, and economic conditions, which was accelerated by a relatively rapid phase-out programme. A discussion section offers insights on the temporality of destabilisation, the context of phase-out decisions, and the interaction of destabilisation and innovation processes.},

There is wide variation in mobility across cities. An exact decomposition shows this variation is driven more by differences in uncongested mobility than congestion. Under plausible assumptions, a one standard deviation improvement in uncongested speed creates much more mobility than optimal congestion pricing. Denser and more populated cities are slower, only in part because of congestion. Urban economic development is correlated with better (uncongested and overall) mobility despite worse congestion.},

The impacts of these policies are unclear in many developing country cities, where a disproportionate share of accident damages occur but also where speed regulations could exacerbate already high levels of congestion. We evaluate a speed limit reduction program in São Paulo, Brazil using a dynamic event study design and measurements of 125 thousand traﬃc accidents, 38 million traﬃc tickets issued by monitoring cameras, and 1.4 million repeat observations of real-time trip durations before and after a regulatory change. We ﬁnd that the program resulted in 1889 averted accidents within the ﬁrst 18 months and reduced accidents by 21.7\% on treated roads, with larger effects on roads with camera-based enforcement. The program also affected travel times on treated roads (5.5\%), though the social beneﬁts from reduced accidents are at least 1.32 times larger than the social costs of longer trip times. The beneﬁts of accident reductions accrue largely to lower income pedestrians and motorcyclists, indicating that speed limit reductions may have important impacts on low income residents in developing country cities.},

In this paper, we focus on demographic factors and develop a simple dynamic model to describe internal migrations, the evolution of the urban rate and total productivity, and how these are affected by population growth and investments in urban infrastructure. Our model can predict basic trends in the data, including urbanisation without growth and the rise of (poor) megacities.

The key dimension of heterogeneity is whether cities are likely to have manufacturing for export outside their regions, as opposed to being exclusively market towns providing local services to agricultural hinterlands. In regions where cities are likely to be manufacturing centers (25\% of our sample), drier conditions increase urbanization and total urban incomes. There, urban migration provides an “escape” from negative agricultural moisture shocks. However, in the remaining market towns (75\% of our sample), cities just service agriculture. Reduced farm incomes from negative shocks reduce demand for urban services and derived demand for urban labor. There, drying has little impact on urbanization or total urban incomes. Lack of structural transformation in Africa inhibits a better response to climate change.},

	abstract = {Today, the world’s fastest-growing cities lie in low-income countries, unlike the historical norm. Also, unlike the “killer cities” of history, cities in low-income countries grow not just through in-migration but also through their own natural increase. First, we use novel historical data to document that many poor countries urbanized at the same time as the postwar urban mortality transition. Second, we develop a framework incorporating location choice with heterogeneity in demographics and congestion costs across locations to account for this. In the framework, people prefer to live in low-mortality locations, and the aggregate rate of population growth and the locational choice of individuals interact. Third, we calibrate this to data from a sample of poor countries and find that informal urban areas (e.g., slums) can absorb additional population more easily than other locations. We show that between 1950 and 2005 the urban mortality transition could have doubled the urbanization rate as well as the size of informal urban areas in this sample. Of these effects, one-third could be attributed to the amenity effect of lower urban mortality rates, while the remainder is due to higher population growth disproportionately pushing people into informal urban areas. Fourth, simulations suggest that family planning programs, as well as industrialization or urban infrastructure and institutions may be effective in slowing poor-country urbanization.

Slum residents pay higher rents and live in lower quality housing (measured via satellite pictures) when the landlord and the locality chief belong to the same ethnicity. Conversely, rental prices are lower, and investments higher when residents and chiefs are co-ethnics. Our identification relies on the exogenous appointment of chiefs and is supported by several tests, including a regression discontinuity design. (JEL J15, O15, O17, O18, R21, R31)},

Interpreting modelled residual damages as unavoided L\&D, a few results emerge from the analysis. First, residual damages turn out to be significant under a variety of IAMs, and for a range of climate scenarios. This means that if adaptationAdaptationis undertaken optimally, there will remain a large amount of damages that are not eliminated. Second the ratio of adaptationAdaptationto total damages varies by region, so residual damages also vary for that reason. Third, residual damages will depend on the climate scenario as well as the discount rate and the assumed parameters of the climate model (equilibrium climate sensitivity) as well as those of the socioeconomic model (damage functions). These uncertainties are very large and so will be any projections of residual damages in the medium to long term. The chapter raises other aspects that could influence estimates of L\&D. An important one is that, since actual adaptationAdaptationis very unlikely to be optimal, the amount of Loss and DamageLoss and damagemay be influenced by the sources from which adaptationAdaptationand Loss and DamageLoss and damageprograms are financed. The level and structure of current limited financial resources is likely to result in adaptationAdaptationthat is significantly below the optimal level and thus result in significant L\&D.},

	abstract = {Il est communément admis que les banques centrales de l'après-guerre (1945-1970s) étaient des administrations passives, contraintes par des taux de change fixes et des politiques budgétaires inflationnistes. Ce point de vue est essentiellement rétrospectif et s'inspire des expériences des États-Unis et du Royaume-Uni. Cette thèse raconte une histoire différente. Eric Monnet montre que la Banque de France était au cœur du système financier et de la planification économique de l'après-guerre, et qu'elle a contribué à la croissance économique à la fois en stabilisant l'inflation et en favorisant les prêts directs aux activités économiques prioritaires. Le crédit a été institutionnalisé en tant qu'objectif social et économique. La politique monétaire et le contrôle du crédit ont été associés. La thèse fournit une analyse historique des décisions de la Banque de France et du Conseil National du Crédit, une analyse quantitative des effets de la politique monétaire et de l'allocation du crédit, ainsi qu'un modèle formel du contrôle du crédit. Elle élargit ensuite son analyse au fonctionnement du système de Bretton Woods.},

It argues that cash transfers are likely to contribute to adaptive capacity by (1) meeting basic needs; (2) helping the poor respond to climate-related shocks; (3) helping vulnerable households to manage risk and consider investment innovations that increase their adaptive capacity; (4) transferring money for investment in long-term adaptive capacity development; and (5) facilitating mobility and livelihood transitions. While the article acknowledges that cash transfers cannot address all areas of adaptation, these transfers may be a prerequisite for further adaptation to be equitable and effective. When compared with other adaptation options, cash transfers fare well as they are supported by a substantial evidence base, do not require much climate-related information, have a demonstrated potential for scaling up and are likely to gain local acceptance.},

Due to their central role in the recent IPCC assessments, and international climate policy analyses more generally, and the high uncertainties related to future projections, IAMs have been critically assessed by scholars from different fields receiving various critiques ranging from adequacy of their methods to how their results are used and communicated. Although IAMs are conceptually diverse and evolved in very different directions, they tend to be criticised under the umbrella of ‘IAMs’. Here we first briefly summarise the IAM landscape and how models differ from each other. We then proceed to discuss six prominent critiques emerging from the recent literature, reflect and respond to them in the light of IAM diversity and ongoing work and suggest ways forward. The six critiques relate to (a) representation of heterogeneous actors in the models, (b) modelling of technology diffusion and dynamics, (c) representation of capital markets, (d) energy-economy feedbacks, (e) policy scenarios, and (f) interpretation and use of model results.},

Ce manuel se veut le plus exhaustif possible sur tout ce qui concerne aujourd'hui la sphère financière, dans un secteur en constante évolution, au niveau des produits proposés, des acteurs concernés, des organismes de contrôle, des nouvelles méthodes de gestion des risques encourus... Il envisage comment les différentes théories monétaires expliquent et interprètent les modifications actuelles de la pratique des banques centrales, en particulier de la Banque Centrale Européenne. Il s'attache aux transformations récentes des marchés financiers, qui remettent en question toutes les connaissances antérieures quant à l'influence de la finance sur le secteur réel de l'économie. Il examine comment les nouveaux organismes de régulation, tant nationaux qu'internationaux, agissent pour éviter le retour des crises dont l'histoire la plus récente est rappelée. Dans un monde où les risques sont de plus en plus présents, les épisodes de crise plus fréquents, il analyse le rôle moderne des institutions financières et comment elles permettent de gérer les risques encourus tant par les entreprises que par les États. Cet ouvrage intéressera non seulement les étudiants des niveaux M1 au doctorat, dans les facultés de droit, de sciences économiques et d'administration des entreprises, les IAE, les écoles de commerce et de management, les écoles d'ingénieurs, mais aussi les cadres de banque et des marchés financiers.

	abstract = {"Any ambitious proposal - ranging from fixing crumbling infrastructure to Medicare for all or preventing the coming climate apocalypse - inevitably sparks questions: how can we afford it? How can we pay for it? Stephanie Kelton points out how misguided those questions really are by using the bold ideas of modern monetary theory (MMT), a fundamentally different approach to using our resources to maximize our potential as a society. We've been thinking about government spending in the wrong ways, Kelton argues, on both sides of the political aisle. Everything that both liberal/progressives and conservatives believe about deficits and the role of money and government spending in the economy is wrong, especially the fear that deficits will endanger long-term prosperity. Through illuminating insights about government debt, deficits, inflation, taxes, the financial system, and financial constraints on the federal budget, Kelton dramatically changes our understanding of how to best deal with important issues ranging from poverty and inequality to creating jobs and building infrastructure. Rather than asking the self-defeating question of how to pay for the crucial improvements our society needs, Kelton guides us to ask: which deficits actually matter? What is the best way to balance the risk of inflation against the benefits of a society that is more broadly prosperous, safer, cleaner, and secure? With its important new ways of understanding money, taxes, and the critical role of deficit spending, MMT busts myths that prevent us from taking action because we can't get beyond the question of how to pay for it"--},

On présente ensuite les trois formes fonctionnelles par l’enchaînement récurrent desquels sa structure se reproduit, à savoir le compte, le monnayage et le paiement. On distingue enfin les trois états dans lesquels elle se donne à voir en tant que fait social total – les états incorporé, objectivé et institutionnalisé – en montrant qu’on peut leur associer respectivement une source spécifique de confiance – éthique, méthodique et hiérarchique. Enfin, en combinant les deux points de vue précédents, on dégage deux de ses traits généralement occultés dans les théories économiques : le fait qu’une monnaie n’a de valeur que dans le contexte sociétal où elle fonctionne comme « capital culturel » ; le fait que sa nature d’opérateur d’appartenance sociale occulte, en dehors de moments de crise, la dimension distributive – sociale et territoriale – de tout régime monétaire.},

	abstract = {This paper takes stock of the achievements and gaps of the emerging field of ecological macroeconomics, which has brought insights from specific schools of macroeconomics—most notably post-Keynesian—to ecological economics, with a strong emphasis on the endogeneity of money. Ecological macroeconomics has proposed fiscal, monetary and prudential reforms to boost ‘green’ investments, and developed new modeling frameworks to explore the interactions between the financial, macroeconomic and biophysical spheres. While these proposals open a broader range of possibilities to engage in a socio-ecological transition than those offered by the current paradigm of a financialized global economy, they paradoxically suffer from similar limitations. By placing much faith in ‘green’ investments, they impose a vision of the transition that presents strong technical and institutional limitations. The field also fails to revisit its own understanding of macroeconomics and of specific phenomena—e.g. financial instability—through a biophysical lens, in spite of increasing transdisciplinary evidence supporting this approach. We suggest overcoming these limitations through institutionalist perspectives that understand money as a language through which value is created and legitimized. Those perspectives seem essential to re-embed the governance of money within a worldview that acknowledges the finiteness and incommensurable values of Earth's life support systems.},

	abstract = {Degrowth lacks a theory of how the state can finance ambitious social-ecological policies and public provisioning systems while maintaining macroeconomic stability during a reduction of economic activity. Addressing this question, we present a synthesis of degrowth scholarship and Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) rooted in their shared understanding of money as a public good and their common opposition to artificial scarcity. We present two arguments. First, we draw on MMT to argue that states with sufficient monetary sovereignty face no obstacle to funding the policies necessary for a just and sustainable degrowth transition. Increased public spending neither requires nor implies GDP growth. Second, we draw on degrowth research to bring MMT in line with ecological reality. MMT posits that fiscal spending is limited only by inflation, and thus the productive capacity of the economy. We argue that efforts to deal with this constraint must also pay attention to social and ecological limits. Based on this synthesis we propose a set of monetary and fiscal policies suitable for a stable degrowth transition, including a stronger regulation of private finance, tax reforms, price controls, public provisioning systems and an emancipatory job guarantee. This approach can support broad democratic mobilization for a degrowth transition.},

This paper starts by documenting why climate change matters for monetary policy: it impacts the economic variables relevant to setting the monetary policy stance, it interacts with fiscal and structural responses and it can generate dislocations in financial markets, which are impossible for monetary policy to ignore. Next, we survey several possible ways central banks can respond to climate change. These range from protective actions to more proactive measures aimed at mitigating climate change and supporting green finance and the transition to sustainable growth. We also discuss the constraints and trade-offs faced by central banks as they respond to climate risks. Finally, focusing on the specific challenges faced by inflation-targeting central banks, we consider how certain design features of this regime might interact with, and evolve in response to, the climate challenge.},

An expanding toolset, heightened prominence and increasingly controversial policies have arguably pushed independent monetary policy towards stronger political intervention. This paper tests the hypothesis of a strengthened politicization of central banks qualitatively – by analyzing recent cases of political meddling – and quantitively – by updating the GMT index and juxtaposing its results to previous updates from 1991 and 2003. Not only the vast temporal gap between this paper and previous GMT analyses, but also the substantial economic developments since the early 2000s motivate this paper to take a refreshed look at the GMT index today. By regressing independence scores against economic indicators, the macroeconomic impact of monetary independence is demonstrated. This paper finds that in both cases, de facto and de jure, a loss in central bank independence has occurred while monetary autonomy still prevails to have a significant impact on inflation, inflation volatility and to a lesser extent on GDP per capita.},

Emphasis is placed on the impact of climate change damages on the price of financial assets and the financial position of firms and banks. The model is estimated and calibrated using global data and simulations are conducted for the period 2016–2120. Four key results arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second, climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third, climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields.},

This paper aims at quantifying the role of international trade in attenuating the effects of climate change by allowing the expression of the new climate-induced pattern of comparative advantages. To do this, we develop a quantitative general equilibrium trade model where the representation of acreage and land use choices is inspired from modern Ricardian trade models but also consistent with theoretical and empirical literature on land use choices. The model is calibrated on spatially explicit information about potential yields before and after climate change coming from the agronomic literature. The results show that the climate-induced yield changes generate large price movements that incentivize adjustments in acreage and trade. The new trade pattern is very different from the current one, showing the important role of trade flows in adapting to climate change. This is confirmed by larger welfare losses from climate change when adjustments in trade flows are constrained versus when they are not.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) module costs have declined rapidly over forty years but the reasons remain elusive. Here we advance a conceptual framework and quantitative method for quantifying the causes of cost changes in a technology, and apply it to PV modules. Our method begins with a cost model that breaks down cost into variables that changed over time. Cost change equations are then derived to quantify each variable's contribution. We distinguish between changes observed in variables of the cost model – which we term low-level mechanisms of cost reduction – and research and development, learning-by-doing, and scale economies, which we refer to as high-level mechanisms. We find that increased module efficiency was the leading low-level cause of cost reduction in 1980–2012, contributing almost 25\% of the decline. Government-funded and private R\&D was the most important high-level mechanism over this period. After 2001, however, scale economies became a more significant cause of cost reduction, approaching R\&D in importance. Policies that stimulate market growth have played a key role in enabling PV's cost reduction, through privately-funded R\&D and scale economies, and to a lesser extent learning-by-doing. The method presented here can be adapted to retrospectively or prospectively study many technologies, and performance metrics besides cost.},

	url = {https://pastel.hal.science/tel-01887812},
	abstract = {Le mode de vie des pays industrialisés, basé sur le consumérisme, est considéré comme l’un des principaux moteurs de l’usage de ressources et de la dégradation de l’environnement global. Sa substitution par d’autres modes de vie constitue l’une des clés pour bâtir un futur soutenable, d’autant qu’il tend à être imité dans les pays émergents et en développement. Pourtant, la question de la transition des modes de vie a été jusqu’à présent relativement peu investie par les politiques publiques, y compris par celles qui visent à répondre aux enjeux de la transition énergétique et de l’atténuation du changement climatique. C’est dans le but d’encourager les parties prenantes de ces enjeux à se saisir de cette question que nos recherches ont été initiées. Pour cela, nous avons choisi de nous concentrer sur la démarche prospective, qui est l’un des outils d’aide à la décision privilégiés pour éclairer les politiques de l’énergie et du changement climatique dont les enjeux portent sur les moyen et long termes. Nous avons constaté que la question était jusqu’à présent très partiellement abordée dans la plupart des exercices de prospective énergie-climat. Ce constat tient en partie au fait que, alors que la pratique actuelle accorde une place importante à la modélisation, le formalisme des modèles utilisés n’a bien souvent pas été pensé pour traiter de cette notion multidimensionnelle. Dans ce contexte, notre contribution porte sur les plans conceptuel et méthodologique. Nous avons dans un premier temps défini un cadre conceptuel pour aborder la notion de mode de vie et clarifier son rôle dans le système énergétique. Dans un second temps, nous avons proposé une approche par la modélisation destinée à simuler des scénarios d’évolution des modes de vie à l’échelle de la France. Cette approche formelle, dont le développement a constitué le cœur de nos recherches, permet de quantifier la demande en logements, la demande en mobilité et la demande en biens et services qui résultent de ces scénarios et définissent la structure des usages de l’énergie. La mise en œuvre de cette approche est illustrée dans ce manuscrit par la simulation de trois scénarios d’évolution des modes de vie.},

	url = {https://pastel.hal.science/tel-01303955},
	abstract = {Together, Central and South America and the Caribbean represent more than 450 million people and 12\% of the Earth's total emerged land. The region stands out in the global energy landscape for the outstanding contribution of renewable sources to its energy production. Maintaining this level of renewable energy in the future might prove a challenging task, as ‘historical' energy sources (hydropower, biomass) run into sustainability issues and ‘new' options (wind, solar, geothermal energy) still depend on public support schemes. However, South America's small fossil resource endowment and excellent renewable potential make it the ideal candidate for pioneering a renewable energy transition. The energy sector's contribution in fueling economic growth in a socially and environmentally sustainable way is also an issue that is particularly significant in the developing context on the continent. Climate change is a region-scale concern. The continent's emissions per capita are above the global average, and the region is also likely to be one of the most impacted by climate change. South America's energy sector is vulnerable both on the supply side (hydropower and biomass resources) and the demand side (increased demand for e.g. agriculture and air conditioning). Despite shared regional strengths and concerns, however, South America appears as a highly heterogeneous and fragmented continent. The region's physical layout is a stumbling block for regional integration. Two centuries of regional wars complicate political cooperation at national level, and the historical evolution has created strong disparities between national energy sectors. Various attempts to cooperate on transnational infrastructure have ended up as costly failures in past years.The aim of this PhD work, half of which was conducted in France and half in Chile, was to develop a mathematical model adapted to the study of long-term energy issues, at a regional scale, for South America. This model, TIMES-América Latina y el Caribe, was applied to studying the impact of national climate policies on regional energy, as the world prepares for a global climate agreement at the Paris conference in December 2015.This document is divided in five chapters. Chapter 1 offers a historical overview of South America's history with a focus on the energy sector, followed by a description of the specificities and challenges of South American energy today. Chapter 2 presents the concepts of prospective and scenario modeling, along with a historical overview and a state-of-the-art of energy prospective in South America. Chapter 3 details the model's main features: its ten-region disaggregation, its modeling rules and the structure and main assumptions for supply and demand, including macroeconomic drivers, resource potentials, and extraction costs. Chapter 4 presents the climate change issue and its implications for South America; it also describes the international climate negotiations, from their beginning in 1972 to the current tentative contributions. Finally, chapter 5 analyses the impacts of these pledges on South America's energy sector, and the contribution of the latter to fulfilling these pledges, as a direct application of the model developed in this thesis.},

They are mainly produced by one category of computer models: Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). We analyse how IAM research organised into a community around the production of socio-economic scenarios during the preparation of the IPCC AR5 (2005-2014). We seek to describe the co-emergence of a research community, its instruments, and its domain of applicability. We highlight the role of the IPCC process in the making of the IAM community, showing how IAMs worked their way to an influent position. We then survey three elements of the repertoire that served to organise collective work on scenarios in interaction with the IPCC and the European Union, and which now frames the community and its epistemic practices. This repertoire needs to articulate epistemic practices with the pursuit of policy relevance, which shows how epistemic communities and patterns of co-production materialise in practical arrangements.},

	abstract = {The aim underlying the notion of a Net zero 2050 future (NZ 2050) is the achievement of a balance between anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by sources, and their removals by carbon sinks, by the mid-point of the current century. This paper delves into the relation between numerical modelling and political decisionmaking in the construction of a NZ future, by examining the recent development of the French national low-carbon strategy (SNBC-2) (2016-2018) and related processes. SNBC-2 was the first attempt to put a NZ2050 France, and the path towards it, into a numerical, calculative form. We show that, aside from yielding a collective capacity to quantify farther into the future, one major lesson of the French attempt at representing NZ2050 was that available models for doing so were of limited relevance. The analysis discusses these shortcomings and their implications with regard to the performativity of numerical models in making NZ2050 a doable horizon. Performativity refers to a circular and dynamic relation between modelling and the realm that they aim to represent (here, NZ2050 future). Modelling a future is thus conceived as an algorithmic and relational process, which contributes to the assembly of all the elements that might compose this future, or to bringing about their emergence. Based on the notion, drawn from science and technology studies, of ‘qualculation’ – which understands calculation as a process that is at once qualitative and quantitative, relational and algorithmic – we underline the crucial, but ambiguous role of non-calculative adjustments used to compensate for the calculative limitations of models. We show that these adjustments can potentially lead to both gain and loss in performativity, depending on whether or not the qualculation process makes them explicit and allows them to be collectively remembered and critically discussed. We also argue that calculative limitations and the resulting adjustments show that the relationship between models and policymaking is somewhat more reciprocal than what has been argued in the literature: models do encapsulate a form of politics which they enact, but they also can be challenged and reshaped by the emergence of new political objectives.},

Based on literature analysis, quantitative document analysis and semi-structured interviews, we describe the historic evolution of the interactions between IAMs and policy-making between 1970 and 2015. We identify five historic phases in which IAMs played distinct mediating roles between science and policy, succeeding to adjust their scenario efforts to the continuously changing demands for knowledge from the policy community. In explaining the prominent role of IAMs, we differentiate between background conditions (material and sociological) and more contextual factors, most notably the flexible, hybrid and broad nature of IAMs as well as the pro-active character of the IAM community to enhance their policy relevance. We draw on the notion of institutional work to explain this success. In light of the urgency of responding to the climate crisis, we suggest that the IAM community may expand their scope of anticipated futures and consider engaging a wider range of publics and societal stakeholders beyond the science-policy interface.},

The model is calibrated to quantify the strength of the effect of schooling on growth by using evidence from the labor literature on Mincerian (1974) returns to education. The upshot is that the impact of schooling on growth explains less than one third of the empirical cross-country relationship. The model is extended to address the choice of schooling, showing that faster growth can induce more schooling by raising its effective return. Calibrating schooling choices suggests that this reverse channel can potentially explain one half or more of the observed relationship between schooling and growth.},

Indirect specification tests are generally consistent with a causal link: direct spending on schools is unrelated to student performance differences; the estimated growth effects of improved labor-force quality hold when East Asian countries are excluded; and, finally, home-country quality differences of immigrants are directly related to U.S. earnings if the immigrants are educated in their own country but not in the United States. The last estimates of micro productivity effects, however, introduce uncertainty about the magnitude of the growth effects. (JEL O40, I20, J24)},

	abstract = {Inspired by postcolonial critiques, urban studies today is characterized by conceptual and methodological experimentation in pursuit of a more global approach to understanding cities. The challenge is to develop methods and theoretical practices which allow conceptual innovation to emerge from any urban situation or urbanization process, sustaining wider conversations while insisting that concepts are open to revision. This maps well on to the core methodological problematic of comparison. Mindful of the strong limits to comparison presented by conventional quasi-scientific methods, this paper sets out the basis for a reformatted comparative method. A new grounding for comparison is proposed, specific to the field of the urban, and a new typology of tactics for undertaking urban comparative research is suggested. The paper weaves together classic approaches and more recent innovations in comparison from within urban studies with a wider philosophical analysis of the issues at stake in reframing the architecture of comparison. The paper stands as an invitation to practise global urban studies differently – comparatively – but also to practise comparison differently, in a way that opens urban studies to a more global repertoire of potential insights. The paper develops this invitation and methodological quest through Marxist political-economy; through actually-existing vernacular comparative practices of urban studies; and through insights gleaned from Gilles Deleuze’s philosophical project. The last section of the paper explains how this new vocabulary of comparative method can be put to work through a review of some recent experiments in the field of global urban studies.},

These shocks to food production can mire farming households in poverty traps. This study investigates whether unconditional cash transfers can help households cope with agricultural production and price shocks. We find that cash empowers poor, rural households facing these negative shocks to employ coping strategies typically used by the non-poor and enables them to substantially increase their food consumption and overall food security. Extending relatively small cash payments unconditionally to the rural poor is a powerful policy option for fostering climate-resilient development.},

Could debt relief be an eﬃcient tool to encourage less developed countries to engage in the ﬁght against climate change? We consider a decrease of the debt of the poor country balanced by an increase of the richer country’s debt. We show that debt relief makes it possible to engage poor countries in the process of pollution abatement. Capital, environmental quality and welfare can increase in both countries. This result relies on the environmental sensitivity and the discount factor in the poor country relative to the rich one: the greater they are the more beneﬁcial the debt relief is.},

L’analyse du cinquième rapport du groupe III du GIEC montre en effet un intérêt grandissant dans la littérature pour les évaluations quantifiées des cobénéfices, en particulier à l’aide de modèles numériques intégrés. Néanmoins, l’évaluation quantifiée à une échelle globale des cobénéfices est confrontée à des difficultés d’ordre méthodologique qui expliquent l’écart entre les pratiques des modélisateurs et la vision théorique des économistes qui repose sur l’analyse coûts-bénéfices. L’article revient enfin sur la nécessité d’élargir le champ d’investigation de l’évaluation des cobénéfices aux politiques non climatiques qui déterminent une part importante des émissions de GES, et constituent un des enjeux majeurs des approches intégrées climat-développement qui montent en puissance dans les négociations climat en cours.},

However, whereas research on natural resources frequently seeks to understand policy outcome through a geopolitical prism, when it comes to electricity studies the prism is always economic or technical. Hence, this study is a ﬁrst attempt to identify the geopolitical dimension of cross-border electricity grids. The study argues that success in establishing electricity grids requires identifying how the geopolitical dimension interplays with the physical dimension. To examine the role of these geopolitical bottlenecks, the study examines negotiation protocols, spanning over 15 years, on establishing ten grid connections between Israel and its Arab neighbors. It ﬁnds that electricity geopolitics has been used both as a platform for deeper international cooperation and as a stick against neighboring states. When policies are driven by a peace dividend, proposals for grid connection appear to evolve and overcome the dependency and the security-economy bottlenecks. When relations deteriorate, proposals for grid connections appear to undergo reconsideration and to be held hostage by higher politics. If, when and how electricity grids materialize is a function of the nature of the electricity network as a twofold package and of the ability of the planning process to accommodate geopolitical uncertainty.},

Yet, energy geography and geopolitics literature lack reference to security and how it may shape the energy landscape. This study unpacks the elusive concepts of security and territoriality and operationalizes them into measurable variables. Using statistical and qualitative methods, including an original dataset based on planning and building protocols, this study tests the interplay between security conditions and territoriality on renewable energy adoption. It examines the case study of the contested Area C territory in the West Bank, within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The findings show that precarious security conditions discourage renewable energy diffusion, particularly when security is linked to territorial conflict. As land-intensive infrastructures, renewable energy systems challenge territorial claims. This study demonstrates how space acts as an intermediate variable connecting security concerns with the diffusion of renewable technology. Security interests use spatial planning as a key mechanism to negatively influence on renewable energy diffusion in contested territory, such as Area C, where power asymmetry heavily leans to the advantage of one party. These findings contradict the argument that renewable energy is a catalyst for peace building. They show how renewable energy projects create inequalities and are often held hostage by the territorial dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.},

Or, la crise économique mondiale puis les révoltes arabes semblent avoir provisoirement relégué au second plan les préoccupations environnementales et surtout énergétiques, les deux dossiers étant par ailleurs de plus en plus étroitement imbriqués. Or, malgré la récente baisse des cours du pétrole, la tendance sur le long terme est plutôt au maintien à un niveau élevé du prix des énergies fossiles, ce qui doit d’ailleurs amener les dirigeants méditerra- néens à réfléchir à un changement accéléré de paradigme énergétique, processus plus ou moins avancé selon les Etats. La Méditerranée et son prolongement proche et moyen oriental restent cependant, et pour le moment, au cœur de la production du principal combustible mondial, le pétrole, tout en possédant des réserves considérables en gaz. D’où l’intérêt de s’interroger sur un certain nombre d’évolutions susceptibles d’affecter cet espace géographique à travers cet enjeu si stratégique qu’est l’énergie qui est aussi politique, économique et environnemental. Il est sûr que, sur ce dernier plan, l’engagement qui s’annonce en matière de lutte contre le changement climatique passera par une redéfinition du mix énergétique.},

un facteur aggravant. On sait l’importance de l’indépendance et de la sécurité énergétiques
pour les États, et c’est ce qui suffit à faire de l’énergie un enjeu géopolitique.
Or la croissance rapide des pays émergents (Chine et Inde surtout, car faibles producteurs)
assure une demande en constante augmentation, qui contribue à mettre quelques grands
pays fournisseurs d’hydrocarbures en position de force non seulement sur les marchés
d’une façon générale, mais aussi vis-à-vis de certains de leurs clients comme l’a démontré
la récente tension russo-ukrainienne. En effet, la dépendance au gaz russe de certains pays
de l’Union européenne, tels que l’Allemagne et les États de l’ex-Europe de l’Est, contribue
à rendre difficile une position commune au sein l’Union pour sanctionner la politique impérialiste
de Vladimir Poutine.
Dans le même temps, un débat s’installe, du niveau planétaire au niveau local, sur
la transition énergétique nécessaire, voire indispensable, pour les uns mais seulement
souhaitable et envisageable pour les autres.},

We rely on a Mexican panel survey to provide novel evidence on the correlation between the occurrence of an international migration episode and changes in household composition. Migrant households have a higher probability of receiving a new member within one year around the migration episode. Attrition is significantly higher among migrant households, and we provide evidence that this is partly due to the dissolution of the household of origin of the migrant. The endogeneity of co-residence choices induces an undercount of migration episodes, as shown with data from the 2000 Census. This has implications for the analysis of migrant selection and of the effects on the individuals left behind. Dealing with these analytical challenges requires an approach to data collection that is less dependent on variations in household composition.},

This improved parameter set results in a World3 simulation that shows the same overshoot and collapse mode in the coming decade as the original business as usual scenario of the LtG standard run. The main effect of the recalibration update is to raise the peaks of most variables and move them a few years into the future. The parameters with the largest relative changes are those related to industrial capital lifetime, pollution transmission delay, and urban-industrial land development time.},

	abstract = {In the 1972 bestseller Limits to Growth (LtG), the authors concluded that, if global society kept pursuing economic growth, it would experience a decline in food production, industrial output, and ultimately population, within this century. The LtG authors used a system dynamics model to study interactions between global variables, varying model assumptions to generate different scenarios. Previous empirical-data comparisons since then by Turner showed closest alignment with a scenario that ended in collapse. This research constitutes a data update to LtG, by examining to what extent empirical data aligned with four LtG scenarios spanning a range of technological, resource, and societal assumptions. The research benefited from improved data availability since the previous updates and included a scenario and two variables that had not been part of previous comparisons. The two scenarios aligning most closely with observed data indicate a halt in welfare, food, and industrial production over the next decade or so, which puts into question the suitability of continuous economic growth as humanity’s goal in the twenty-first century. Both scenarios also indicate subsequent declines in these variables, but only one—where declines are caused by pollution—depicts a collapse. The scenario that aligned most closely in earlier comparisons was not amongst the two closest aligning scenarios in this research. The scenario with the smallest declines aligned least with empirical data; however, absolute differences were often not yet large. The four scenarios diverge significantly more after 2020, suggesting that the window to align with this last scenario is closing.},

This report was both highly successful and polemic. The main detractors of the model criticized it for being too approximate in the choice of the parameters and for beeing too simplistic. The objective of this paper is to revisit some aspects of the scientiﬁc validation of this model, in a context where growth is widely debated in the scientiﬁc and civil community, through a new and more sophisticated sensitivity analysis of the model, compared to what is available in the literature.},

	abstract = {Aiming at meeting the global goals established for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction, carbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a key role. In this framework, the adsorption-based CO2 post-combustion capture is considered one of the most promising approaches because it can provide remarkable energy savings with respect to the standard amine-based absorption capture. To date, most of the research eﬀort has been devoted to the development of novel cutting-edge adsorbent materials with the primary purpose of enhancing the adsorption capacity and lifetime while reducing the heat of adsorption, thus lessening the energetic requirement of the sorbent regeneration. Anyway, other factors, beyond the sorbents, greatly aﬀect the competitiveness of the CO2 capture based on the adsorption route, namely, the gas−solid contacting system, impacting the sorbent utilization eﬃciency, and the regeneration strategies, determining most of the global CO2 capture costs. This review describes the state-of-the-art and most recent progresses of the adsorption-based CO2 post-combustion capture. In particular, the ﬁrst section describes the CO2 adsorption performances of diﬀerent classes of solid sorbents on the basis of the most important evaluation parameters (equilibrium adsorption capacity, multi-cyclic stability, etc.). In the second section, the two main gas−solid contacting systems, i.e., ﬁxed beds and ﬂuidized beds, have been reviewed, pointing out their strengths and limitations. Finally, the third section provides a review on the diﬀerent regeneration modes (temperature, pressure, or hybrid swings), with a focus on the possible strategies available to limit the energy penalty.},

	abstract = {CCS, Carbon Capture and Storage, is considered a promising technology to abate CO2 emissions from point sources. The present review deals with the principle of post-combustion capture techniques, including thermal or pressure swing principles, adsorption or absorption, and electrical swing or membrane separation processes. Opportunities and challenges are assessed. In the first section of absorption processes, several commercial technologies are compared and complemented by the aqueous or chilled ammonia (NH3) process, and a dual or strong alkali absorption. The second section deals with adsorption where fixed beds, circulating fluidized beds and counter-current bed configurations will be discussed, with particular focus on the different adsorbents ranging from zeolites or activated carbon, to more complex amine-functionalized adsorbents, nanotubes or metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and alkali-promoted oxides. Thirdly, membrane processes will be analysed. The review will finally summarize challenges and opportunities. Several research groups confirmed that absorption is the most mature post-combustion capture process: among the assessment of post-combustion CCS, 57\% apply absorption, 14\% rely on adsorption, 8\% use membranes, and 21\% apply mineralization or bio-fixation. This conclusion was in-line with expectations since absorption gas separation has been largely applied in various petrochemical industries. All other systems need further development prior to large scale application.},

	abstract = {Opposition to climate policies seems to arise, at least partly, from their effects on inequality. However, so far, the impact of climate policies on inequality has mainly been studied through the lens of income inequality, and their spatial dimension is poorly understood. This paper, using Cape Town, South Africa, as a case study, investigates the impact of a fuel tax on both spatial and income inequalities. It uses a model derived from the standard urban economics land use model, accounting for four income classes and four housing types. This modeling framework allows decomposing the impacts of the tax by income class, housing type, and housing location. The analysis also decomposes the impacts of the tax over different timeframes, assuming that households and developers progressively adapt to the tax. The findings reveal strong evidence that in the short term, there are both income and spatial inequalities, with households being more negatively impacted by the fuel tax if they earn low incomes or live far from employment centers. In the medium and long term, these inequalities persist: the poorest households, living in informal settlements or subsidized housing, have few or no ways to adapt to changes in fuel prices by changing housing type, adjusting their dwelling sizes or locations, or shifting transportation modes. Low-income households living in formal housing also remain impacted by the tax over the long term due to complex effects driven by the competition with richer households on the housing market. Complementary policies promoting a functioning labor market that allows people to change jobs easily, affordable public transportation, or subsidies helping low-income households to rent houses closer to employment centers will be key to enable the social acceptability of climate policies.},

	abstract = {Urban green spaces provide cultural ecosystem services, and urban policies typically aim to enhance these services by targeting new investments in deprived areas. The implementation of urban greening policies is one way to reduce inequalities in well-being, for example by targeting areas where increased access to green spaces will benefit citizens of low socioeconomic status. Most research has addressed the targeting of green infrastructure development by considering income and access to green spaces, while few studies have considered a multidimensional definition of well-being. The aims of this paper are to i) integrate inputs from the economic and political philosophy literature to propose a broader definition of well-being, including health, education, insecurity, and social relations; ii) develop a criterion to prioritise areas where urban greening would have the greatest impact on well-being inequalities; and iii) apply this criterion to the Paris metropolitan area (Ile-de-France region), a spatially heterogeneous region where areas deprived of access to green spaces are not systematically deprived in other dimensions. Our analysis shows that the city of Paris and the inner suburbs would be targeted when considering inequality in access to green spaces only. The results differ when inequalities in income or multidimensional well-being are taken into account, in which case the northern inner suburbs and some outer suburbs become a higher priority.},

Many academics share similar feelings about what they perceive as helpful devices or methods which should aid and improve managerial decision‐making. (Why, for example, don't managers attempt to assess the expected value of information?) Perhaps the answer is that the academics have failed to communicate both the nature of the technique and its application. If this is so then the burden of proof rests with the advocate and in this paper the reader is led from simple to complex issues which the author has found to be the causes of misunderstanding or misuse in his own extensive consulting experience.},

This suggests that once price risk is resolved through the offer of a fixed-price contract, farmers are able to address other constraints on their own.},

This is the result of increasing demand for water, reduction of water resources, and increasing pollution of water, driven by dramatic population and economic growth. It is suggested that this number may be an underestimation, and scarcity of clean water by 2050 may be worse as the effects of the three drivers of water scarcity, as well as of unequal growth, accessibility and needs, are underrated. While the report promotes the spontaneous adoption of nature-based-solutions within an unconstrained population and economic expansion, there is an urgent need to regulate demography and economy, while enforcing clear rules to limit pollution, preserve aquifers and save water, equally applying everywhere. The aim of this paper is to highlight the inter-linkage in between population and economic growth and water demand, resources and pollution, that ultimately drive water scarcity, and the relevance of these aspects in local, rather than global, perspective, with a view to stimulating debate.},

	abstract = {En Belgique comme partout ailleurs, le secteur de l’énergie est amené à se remettre profondément en question. En effet, les modes traditionnels de production d’énergie ont montré leurs limites et leurs dangers : l’utilisation du pétrole, du charbon et du gaz repose sur des réserves appelées à se tarir et a d’importantes répercussions sur l’environnement, tandis que le nucléaire comporte de grands risques et reste soumis à la question du traitement des déchets radioactifs. Dès lors, une « transition énergétique », consistant en un recours accru aux sources d’énergie vertes (vent, soleil, etc.), s’impose de plus en plus comme une alternative raisonnable, voire incontournable. Ce mouvement est à l’œuvre à l’échelle mondiale, selon des rythmes de progression différents, et particulièrement au sein de l’Union européenne. 
Passer des énergies fossiles aux énergies renouvelables constitue cependant un véritable défi. Nombreuses sont les difficultés qui font obstacle aux volontés des mandataires politiques, des professionnels de l’énergie (producteurs, distributeurs, etc.) et des consommateurs (ménages et entreprises). En particulier, se pose le problème de la manière d’intégrer les énergies vertes, par nature produites de façon décentralisée et intermittente, dans le réseau déjà existant. Le recours au numérique et à une plus grande flexibilité de l’ensemble du système constitue aujourd’hui un enjeu central. Sans oublier que le renouvelable, subsidié par les pouvoirs publics, a pour effet d’augmenter le coût global de l’énergie.
Centré sur le cas de la Belgique, ce Courrier hebdomadaire permet de saisir la complexité de l’équation énergétique qui est actuellement en place, équation qui est soumise aux premiers effets de la transition énergétique, ainsi qu’aux mutations et défis que celle-ci implique et aux contraintes qu’elle rencontre, notamment dans le cadre d’un État fédéral. Une attention particulière est réservée aux divers acteurs qui interviennent dans le débat. Spécialement, F. Collard analyse les différents éléments qui composent la facture d’électricité des ménages ; cet exercice explique les raisons pour lesquelles, bien qu’elle coûte de moins en moins à produire, l’énergie est vendue toujours plus chère aux particuliers.},

Slow and permanent changes in climate-driven geographical conditions, i.e. CC as defined by the IPCC (2013), have been studied relatively less, especially in Africa which remains the most vulnerable continent to CC. We focus on Lake Chad, which used to be the 11th-largest lake in the world. This African lake the size of El Salvador, Israel, or Massachusetts slowly shrunk by 90\% for exogenous reasons between 1963 and 1990. While water supply decreased, land supply increased, generating a priori ambiguous effects. These effects make the increasing global disappearance of lakes a critical trend to study. For Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, and Niger  25\% of sub-Saharan Africa's population , we construct a novel data set tracking population patterns at a fine spatial level from the 1940s to the 2010s. Difference-in-differences show much slower growth in the proximity of the lake, but only after the lake started shrinking. These effects persist two decades after the lake stopped shrinking, implying limited adaptation. Additionally, the negative water supply effects on fishing, farming, and herding outweighed the growth in land supply and other positive effects. A quantitative spatial model used to rationalize these results and estimate aggregate welfare losses taking into account adaptation shows overall losses of about 6\%. The model also allows us to study the aggregate and spatial effects of policies related to migration, land use, trade, roads, and cities.},

	abstract = {Due to identification concerns, empirical studies of the economic effects of climate change typically rely on “climate shocks” for their analysis, hence year-to-year climate variations. The effects of slow and permanent changes in climate-driven geographical conditions, i.e. climate change as defined by the IPCC, have been investigated very little in comparison. We focus on Lake Chad, a vast African lake the size of Israel, El Salvador or Massachusetts that, for exogenous reasons, shrunk by 90\% between the 1960s and the late 1980s. While water supply decreased, land supply increased, generating a priori ambiguous effects, and making the increasing worldwide disappearance of lakes an important trend to study.

For black households in South Africa, the social pension is large, highly anticipated, and shared across generations. Moreover, pension benefits are largely determined by age in South Africa's extremely poor black population, and this study uses the age discontinuity in the pension benefit formula for identification. The South African social pension thus presents an unusually clean test of the applicability of the Life-Cycle/Permanent Income model to child labor and schooling decisions in developing countries. In the present case, the data support the theory that liquidity constraints contribute to high levels of child labor. When households become eligible for the social pension in South Africa, the resulting increase in household non-labor income is associated with a sizeable decline in child labor and increases in schooling. Changes in child labor and schooling are largest among pensioners with little formal education. This finding suggests that the current emphasis in development policy of addressing child labor by attacking labor demand may be misdirected.},

	url = {https://geoconfluences.ens-lyon.fr/glossaire/vulnerabilite},
	abstract = {La vulnérabilité exprime le niveau d'effet prévisible d'un phénomène naturel (un aléa) sur des enjeux (les sociétés humaines et leurs activités). Elle est traduite en anglais par les termes vulnerability ou sensitivity. La notion de vulnérabilité évalue dans quelle mesure un système socio-spatial risque d’être affecté par les effets d’un aléa et cherche à quantifier ce qui est perdu.
 Les approches en termes de vulnérabilité sont assez récentes, elles datent des années 1960 - 1970 dans le monde anglo-saxon et des années 1980 en France. La vulnérabilité, en englobant les enjeux, exprime un degré d’exposition à l’aléa qui peut être évalué par le niveau d’endommagement constaté ou prévu.
 La vulnérabilité humaine évalue d’abord les préjudices potentiels aux personnes dans leur intégrité physique (décès, blessés, etc.). La vulnérabilité économique traduit généralement le degré de perte ou d’endommagement des biens et des activités exposés au phénomène.
 L’analyse de la vulnérabilité s’appuie sur une description de l’impact du dommage selon différents critères : sensibilité au dommage, degré de dépendance, la transférabilité, qui mesure la capacité d'adaptation et la résilience, qui mesure la capacité de cicatrisation après l’événement.
 Les principaux facteurs socio-spatiaux de la vulnérabilité sont, pour la plupart, liés à la pauvreté. C'est en effet elle qui pousse les populations démunies des grandes villes des pays du Sud à s'installer sur des zones à risques d'éboulement et d'inondation (Mexico, Quito, Guatemala City, etc.) et c'est elle qui, en intensifiant la dégradation écologique de l'environnement (par la déforestation pour la mise en culture de nouvelles terres notamment), aggrave les conséquences de l'aléa naturel. Ainsi, rapportés à la population, les chiffres sont éloquents : sur 1 million d'habitants, le risque annuel de mort par séisme est de 92 en Arménie, 41 au Turkménistan, 29 en Iran et 25 au Pérou, alors qu'il n'est que de 0,6 en Californie, pour prendre des localisations à forte sismicité. Néanmoins, les populations de pays dits développés ne sont pas pour autant exempt de toute vulnérabilité et s’installent parfois dans des zones à risque faute d’information nécessaire, ce qui est à l’origine de catastrophes majeures (cas de l’ouragan Katrina à la Nouvelle-Orléans en 2005).
 Les défauts de perception de la vulnérabilité s’expliquent en partie par les défauts de perception de la part de responsabilité des individus et des sociétés dans la catastrophe, parce qu’il est relativement difficile d’accepter ses propres fragilités. Percevoir la vulnérabilité implique d’accepter le fait que les risques sont aussi le résultat de facteurs internes aux sociétés, et pas seulement le fruit du hasard (aléa). Cette faible perception génère (autant que l’absence de perception d’un aléa) une sous-estimation du risque.

In this paper we review some of the practical and theoretical issues in implementation of RD methods.},

	abstract = {Vulnerability is complex because it involves many characteristics of people and groups that expose them to harm and limit their ability to anticipate, cope with, and recover from harm. The subject is also complex because workers in many disciplines such as public health, psychology, geography, and development studies (among others) have different ways of defining, measuring, and assessing vulnerability. Some of these practitioners focus on the shortterm identification of vulnerability, so that maps and lists of people living “at risk” can be generated and used by authorities. Others are more concerned with reasons why some people are more vulnerable when facing a hazard or threat than others. Professionals working at the scale of localities are interested in methods that bring out residents’ own knowledge of hazards and help them to cooperate with each other to find ways of reducing risk. There are some interpretations of vulnerability that seek its root cause in the creation of risk by political and economic systems that make investment and locational decisions for the benefit of small elites without regard for how these decisions affect the majority. Finally, whatever success there may be in treating vulnerability in any of the ways just mentioned, it will always be a part of the human condition, and this fact in itself is puzzling.},

	abstract = {Le rapport L'évaluation socioéconomique des investissements publics confié à Emile Quinet par le Commissariat général à la stratégie et à la prospective met à jour et enrichit la méthodologie d'évaluation socioéconomique des investissements publics, étudie les conditions d'une bonne appropriation de ses résultats par les décideurs, et étend le calcul socioéconomique au-delà de ses champs d'application traditionnels que sont les transports et l'énergie. En cette période de fortes contraintes budgétaires, probablement amenée à se prolonger dans les années à venir, il est plus que jamais nécessaire de rationaliser les dépenses publiques, qu'elles soient de fonctionnement ou d'investissement. Les dépenses publiques d'investissement représentent environ 15 \% des investissements totaux de notre pays. Elles concernent des secteurs aussi essentiels pour le développement de notre société que les transports, l'énergie, la santé ou l'éducation. Ces investissements façonneront sur le long terme, parfois pour plusieurs siècles, l'aspect de notre pays, la qualité de son environnement, sa capacité à affronter les défis futurs. C'est dire combien les décisions doivent être prises de la façon la plus éclairée possible, en évaluant au mieux les avantages qu'ils vont procurer et les coûts qu'ils vont engendrer, d'autant que leur financement repose en large partie sur l'épargne publique nationale, ressource rare en général et encore plus dans la période actuelle. Ce n'est donc pas sans raison que l'État s'est préoccupé depuis longtemps d'élaborer et de mettre régulièrement à jour les méthodes permettant d'assurer ces évaluations. La commission qui a réalisé les travaux présentés dans ce rapport L'évaluation socioéconomique des investissements publics se situe dans la lignée d'une longue tradition, initiée par les rapports établis par Marcel Boiteux en 1994 et 2001. Ces rapports ont fixé la doctrine générale et ont permis des avancées sur des sujets particuliers : le taux d'actualisation, la prise en compte du risque, la valeur tutélaire du carbone. Les principes sur lesquels elle s'appuie sont simples et de construction ancienne. Ils consistent à jauger les conséquences de chaque projet sur l'ensemble de la collectivité nationale, en évaluant les gains de productivité ou de capacité de production apportés aux entreprises ainsi que les suppléments de consommation marchande et les améliorations de qualité de vie procurés aux citoyens, et en permettant de comparer ces effets aux coûts de l'investissement. - See more at: http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/publications/levaluation-socioeconomique-investissements-publics-tome1\#sthash.YjQcZR3S.dpuf},

	abstract = {It is generally considered that the perennial glaciation of Greenland lasting several orbital cycles began around 2.7 Ma along with the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG). Both data and model studies have demonstrated that a decline in atmospheric pCO2 was instrumental in establishing a perennial Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), yet models have generally used simplistic pCO2 constraints rather than data-inferred pCO2 evolution. Here, using a method designed for the long-term coupling of climate and cryosphere models and pCO2 scenarios from different studies, we highlight the pivotal role of pCO2 on the GrIS expansion across the Plio-Pleistocene Transition (PPT, 3.0–2.5 Ma), in particular in the range between 280 and 320 ppm. Good qualitative agreement is obtained between various IRD reconstructions and some of the possible evolutions of the GrIS simulated by our model. Our results underline the dynamism of the GrIS waxing and waning under pCO2 levels similar to or lower than today, which supports recent evidence of a dynamic GrIS during the Plio-Pleistocene.},

These changes raise questions such as: Who and what are vulnerable to the multiple environmental changes underway, and where? Research demonstrates that vulnerability is registered not by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses) alone but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such hazards. This recognition requires revisions and enlargements in the basic design of vulnerability assessments, including the capacity to treat coupled human–environment systems and those linkages within and without the systems that affect their vulnerability.

Caractérisés par leur sensibilité au monde matériel et aux normes sociales, les corps appréhendés par Judith Butler sont à la fois existentiellement « précaires » et dotés de capacités de résistance conditionnées par les infrastructures et réseaux d'interdépendances dans lesquels ils s'insèrent. Ces corps « sensibles » sont au fondement d’une théorie politique critique des approches libérales de la souveraineté, sur laquelle Judith Butler revient ici dans un texte inédit. Autour de cet article, ce dossier met en dialogue les politiques du sensible élaborées par la philosophe et les traditions critiques, en particulier les théories de la démocratie radicale, l’école de Francfort et la théorie des affects.Although not quite as well known as her seminal contributions to queer and feminist theory, Judith Butler’s philosophy of precariousness provides an original and insightful perspective on the relationship between bodies and politics. The bodies in Judith Butler’s work are sensitive to the material world and to social norms; they are at once existentially "precarious", and they have a capacity for resistance that is inherently conditioned by the infrastructures in which they operate, and the relational networks in which they take part. Such "sensitive" bodies are also at the roots of a political theory that entails a critique of liberal notions of sovereign selfhood—a critique to which Judith Butler returns in this issue, in an unpublished article. Taking her contribution as an invitation to deepen and extend engagements with her politics of the sensible, this issue stages a dialogue between Judith Butler’s work and a series of critical traditions within political theory: radical democracy, critical theory, and affect theory.},

	abstract = {The 2010 census round has shown a significant growth in the number of countries collecting ethnic and racial data as a consequence of the increasing consciousness of their internal ethnic diversity and to implement more active equality policies addressing ethno-racial discrimination. However, Europe is not part of this dynamic: almost nothing has changed on the ethnic statistics’ frontline in between the two census rounds. This article addresses some of the justification for the enduring resistance of “statistical blindness” to ethnoracial diversity in Europe, locating it mainly in the strategy to erase race from the public sphere as a leverage to combat racism. The limits of this strategy in the context of mass migration from former colonial empires where racial subordination and classification have been produced and developed are discussed. Europe should ultimately face its past domination (rebranded but still active today) without silencing its consequences.},

	abstract = {L’idéologie dominante nous enjoint de tolérer l’Autre. Les textes de Christine Delphy nous montrent que celui qui n’est pas un Autre, c’est l’homme, et l’homme blanc. C’est sur la base du sexe, de l'orientation sexuelle, de la religion, de la couleur de peau et de la classe que se fait la construction sociale de l’altérité. L’Autre c’est la femme, le pédé, l’Arabe, l’indigène, le pauvre. La république libérale tolère, c’est-à-dire qu’elle tend la main, prenant bien garde à laisser le toléré-dominé suspendu au vide. L’homo est toléré s’il sait rester discret, le musulman est toléré s’il se cache pour prier, la femme est tolérée si ses revendications égalitaires n’empiètent pas sur le salaire et le pouvoir de l’homme, l’oriental est toléré s’il laisse les armées américaines tuer sa famille pour le libérer de la dictature – et libérer sa femme de lui-même par la même occasion. L’injonction à s’intégrer est surtout une sommation à être semblable, à suivre les règles officieuses mais bien réelles de "l’Occident". Parité, combats féministes et homosexuels, Afghanistan, Guantanamo, indigènes et société postcoloniale, loi sur le voile : autant de prismes pour analyser les dominations, tant hétérosexistes, racistes, que capitalistes. Ceux et celles qui refusent ces règles, ceux et celles qui se montrent pour ce qu’ils et elles sont, le paient le prix fort, combattant-e-s d’une guerre qui sera longue.   Écrits dans un style offensif, incisif et souvent drôle, ces textes nous forcent à déplacer notre regard, à mettre en lien des événements toujours cloisonnés, et nous apportent ce supplément d’intelligence qui seul permet de comprendre le monde tel qu’il va.},

Il examine la manière dont l’impératif de résilience a été appliqué dans ce champ, à partir des enjeux de gouvernance que la traduction opérationnelle de cette notion soulève. L’article s’appuie sur une démarche qualitative reposant sur des entretiens formels, de l’observation participante et non participante, des échanges informels réguliers avec certains acteurs et l’analyse des documents de littérature grise. Il présente d’abord l’organisation de la gestion des risques et des crises, en soulignant la complexité du système d’acteurs, qui fait écho à la fois au cloisonnement de la gouvernance de la sécurité et à la fragmentation territoriale. Il étudie ensuite la manière dont la résilience a été appropriée par les différents acteurs de terrain en charge de son application dans le champ de la sécurité. Il montre que la résilience n’implique pas forcément un changement de pratique radical, mais qu’elle est une opportunité pour accompagner une réorganisation de la gouvernance des risques et de la sécurité qui interfère avec la recomposition de la gouvernance territoriale engagée depuis plusieurs années.},

Pas tout le temps, pas avec la même intensité et parfois les actions des gouvernements n’ont aucun effet alors que d’autres processus contribuent à la direction, l’évolution, la gouvernance de la société. La gouvernance concerne les formes de pilotage, de coordination et de direction des individus, des groupes, des secteurs, des territoires, et de la société, au-delà des organes classiques du gouvernement. Ce n’est pas une idée neuve – on en trouve par exemple des traces dans le latin médiéval avec le terme gubernantia –, avec trois points centraux : l’idée de donner une direction à la société (comme un gouvernail), de mobiliser une coalition et enfin d’exercer une contrainte, soit trois dimensions essentielles du politique. Cette direction distingue la gouvernance d’un autre champ de recherche connexe, celui de la régulation (Levi-Faur, 2012). Alors que l’État, et plus précisément une partie spécialisée, le gouvernement central, était en charge, d’une part, de la direction de la société et de l’exercice de la contrainte et, d’autre part, de l’agrégation des différents intérêts pour la définition de l’intérêt général dans les sociétés européennes, les transformations actuelles vécues par ce même État – processus de différenciation interne, d’européanisation et de globalisation, de dénationalisation de l’autorité politique (King et Le Galès, 2017) – remettent en cause les conceptions traditionnelles hiérarchiques de l’autorité et de la direction de l’action publique, rendant par là même pertinent le recours à la notion de gouvernance…},

Ein solcher Vorgang sozialer Magie hatte nur am Ausgang eines langen Prozesses der Institutionalisierung stattfinden können, an dem Fachleute und Weise beteiligt worden waren. Beruhend auf dem Unterschied von « gebürtigem Franzosen » und «Franzose durch Erlangung der Staatsangehörigkeit » scheint den Statistikern diese statistische Kategorie des Einwanderers klar und eindeutig, in ihrer praktischen Anwendung wirft sie indes gewisse Schwierigkeiten auf. Diese mit Unterstützung der «Ständigen demographischen Stichprobe » (Échantillon démographique permanent) durchgeführte Zeitstudie der Entwicklung der Angaben zur Staatsangehörigkeit hebt diesbezugliche Unschärfezonen hervor, die im Rahmen der regelmäfêig durchgeführten Auswertungen unter den Tisch zu fallen drohen.},

Despite the significance of CCUS technologies to a multitude of climate mitigation scenarios, research has identified a series of challenges to deployment, ranging from cost overruns and technical failures to public opposition. Research has widely documented the range of techno-economic challenges impacting the feasibility of individual technologies. However, a growing body of research calls for the feasibility of CCUS to be assessed more holistically, with greater focus on systemic, societal and other non-technical issues. Through a meta-review of 22 recent multidisciplinary review papers on CCUS, we identify and explore a comprehensive set of challenges impacting CCUS deployment. The results show a continued focus on the techno-economic dimensions within literature. However, the meta-review also unfolds a series of issues receiving less attention in literature, from organisational and environmental challenges to issues of legitimacy. Overall, this paper contributes to a broader understanding of the critical challenges facing CCUS projects in the coming decade and provides a framework for a more holistic assessment of climate mitigation technologies such as CCUS.},

Based on the Web of Science (WOS) database platform and CitNet-Explorer software, the present study explore the international research progress, topic evolution track, research hotspot and research trend of CCUS technology since its birth nearly 30 years ago, using bibliometric method, citation network visualization analysis method and cluster analysis method. Through the analysis of literature citation network, it is found that: 16 CCUS topics, 6 hotspots have been studied in the last three decades. The topics of CCUS studies present an evolution path from CCUS technology security and economicfeasibility analysis to CCUS technological popularization, and then CCUS technological improvement and development. Cutting-edge CCUS looks at the process and infrastructure construction, cost effectiveness and development prospect analysis.

Since the 12th Five-year Plan, China has included this technology as part of its future national carbon mitigation strategies. China's policy framework in relation to CCUS has had a strong influencing role in the technology's progress to date. This paper employs the “policy cycle” to analyze China's existing CCUS regulatory framework at the national and provincial level, evaluate its performance and clarify its shortcomings in light of the comparisons of policy movements undertaken in other countries. The results indicate that China's CCUS policy is insufficient for further development of the technology and many issues remain to be solved. This includes the lack of an enforceable legal framework, insufficient information for the operationalization of projects, weak market stimulus, and a lack of financial subsidies. These factors may be the reason we have seen low participation rates of Chinese companies in CCUS and little public understanding of what the technology offers. To overcome these challenges, suggestions are provided for improving China's CCUS legal and policy framework.},

But there is no supply-side mitigation roadmap yet. We need criteria to decide where to focus efforts. Here, we identify the 425 biggest fossil fuel extraction projects globally (defined as {\textgreater}1 gigaton potential CO2 emissions). We list these “carbon bombs” by name, show in which countries they are located and calculate their potential emissions which combined exceed the global 1.5 °C carbon budget by a factor of two. Already producing carbon bombs account for a significant percentage of global fossil fuel extraction. But 40\% of carbon bombs have not yet started extraction. Climate change mitigation efforts cannot ignore carbon bombs. Defusing them could become an important dimension of climate change mitigation policy and activism towards meeting the Paris targets. So far, few actors, mainly from civil society, are working on defusing carbon bombs, but they are focussing on a very limited number of them. We outline a priority agenda where the key strategies are avoiding the activation of new carbon bombs and putting existing ones into “harvest mode”.},

Pour comprendre comment s’opère ce retour, la thèse étudie la médiatisation des frontières dans la presse ouest-européenne. Au croisement de la géographie politique et de l'étude des médias, j'analyse quand, où et comment les frontières font l'objet de discours médiatisés. Cette approche des discours par le concept d'agenda s'intéresse aux structures temporelles et géographiques de la médiatisation des frontières. Elle analyse les régimes discursifs des frontières dans le temps (2013-2019) et les compare dans l'espace européen du corpus (Allemagne, Espagne, France, Italie, Royaume-Uni). Une première démarche consiste à modéliser l'agenda médiatique des frontières. Dans un corpus de journaux de presse quotidienne en ligne, elle étudie la place de la frontière et son contenu sémantique et spatial par des méthodes d'analyses textuelle et spatio-temporelle des données. Elle identifie les moments de transition et de synchronisation discursive des sphères médiatiques nationales constituant des moments de « crise » des frontières où se reconfigurent leurs représentations. Une seconde démarche consiste à étudier le rôle géopolitique des discours médiatiques sur la frontière dans deux moments de transition. En devenant des enjeux frontaliers, la relation Ukraine- Russie en 2014 et les migrations en 2015, constituent des séquences discursives où la frontière opère comme un objet géographique organisant des oppositions politiques (Russie/Ukraine, Migrant/Réfugié).},

	abstract = {A fashionable concept, resilience is now a must in both academic research and management. However, its polysemy nourishes many debates on its uses, heuristics and operational relevance. The purpose of this article is not to bring these debates to a close. Starting from a cross-disciplinary state of the art, we point out the incompatibilities between certain meanings and uses of the term. These inconsistencies raise theoretical issues, leading some researchers to reject the term for that matter, especially those outside the cindynics field. The analysis of the concept also brings out some methodological pitfalls. These are evident when attempting to translate theory into operational terms. Resilience is indeed seen as a promising response to recurrent difficulties in risk management. Nevertheless, it solves them only partially and produces new ones. Lastly, its implementation involves ethical and political risks. The injunction to resilience that seems to prevail internationally is in fact implying a number of moral and ideological assumptions which are not always clearly stated and remain serious issues.},

In this paper I seek to specify a social location for left—liberal politics among a distinctive cadre of social and cultural professionals, the cultural new class. This cadre also bears a distinct geographical identity, with an overconcentration in the central cities of large metropolitan areas, not least in their gentrifying districts. The part played since 1968 by the cultural new class in these gentrifying districts in redefining the urban politics of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver is examined. In particular, the role of a gentrifying middle class in challenging a postwar hegemony of growth boosterism practised by the conservative regimes in all three cities, and their parallel attempt to sustain an alternative regime of reform politics, are assessed.},

We have been made and re-made without knowing exactly why, how, and to what end. How then, can we better exercise this right to the city? But whose rights and whose city? Could we not construct a socially just city? But what is social justice? Is justice simply whatever the ruling class wants it to be? We live in a society in which the inalienable rights to private property and the profit rate trump any other conception of inalienable rights. Our society is dominated by the accumulation of capital through market exchange. To live under capitalism is to accept or submit to that bundle of rights necessary for endless capital accumulation. Free markets are not necessarily fair. Worse still, markets require scarcity to function. The inalienable rights of private property and the profit rate lead to worlds of inequality, alienation and injustice. The endless accumulation of capital and the conception of rights embedded threin must be opposed and a different right to the city must be asserted politically. Derivative rights (like the right to be treated with dignity) should become fundamental and fundamental rights (of private property and the profit rate) should become derivative. But new rights can also be defined: like the right to the city which is not merely a right of access to what the property speculators and state planners define, but an active right to make the city different, to shape it more in accord with our heart's desire, and to re-make ourselves thereby in a different image.},

The scale of wealth generated through financialization is difficult to fathom, and corporate ownership of housing markets has transformed cities around the world. The impacts of financialized housing are felt in every corner of the world. Key effects of financialization include increases in rent, foreclosures of homes, and decreases in affordable housing. There are significant human rights implications to governments’ role in enabling the financialization of housing. In this chapter, we explore the human right to housing in the context of the global financialization of housing. Utilizing a human rights lens, we highlight the ways in which financialized housing policies and practices drive homelessness, poverty, inequality, and human rights violations around the world. We explore governance in the age of financialization, underscoring the need for a paradigmatic shift capable of reclaiming the human right to housing.},

It is important to understand how people associate emotions with urban places, or create “subjective” urban experiences in order to regenerate neighborhoods that are sensitive to our mental and emotional health and well-being. In this study, we analyzed photovoice-generated photos (n = 265), focus group and interview transcripts, and emotional maps as part of a brownfield revitalization planning effort in a post-industrial transitional neighborhood of Philadelphia, USA. We coded 13 themes to represent places, spaces, or topics and documented eight primary emotions associated with the photos. Joy was the most mentioned emotion, although the total number of negative emotions (e.g., sadness, anger, and disgust) far exceeded positive ones. Emotional maps revealed positive and negative hotspots and displayed how a single location or topic could trigger multiple contrasting or complementary emotions. A major contribution of this study is its methodological novelty of creating emotional maps with data collected from photovoice, interviews, and focus groups. Another contribution is an innovative community engagement approach involving underrepresented stakeholders in the process of planning for the revitalization of a transitional neighborhood facing pressure from development and gentrification.},

	abstract = {Transient simulations are performed over the entire last millennium with a general circulation model that couples the atmosphere, ocean, and the land surface with a closed carbon cycle. This setup applies a high-detail reconstruction of anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) as the only forcing to the climate system with two goals: (1) to isolate the effects of ALCC on the carbon cycle and the climate independently of any other natural and anthropogenic disturbance and (2) to assess the importance of preindustrial human activities. With ALCC as only forcing, the terrestrial biosphere experiences a net loss of 96 Gt C over the last millennium, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO2 by 20 ppm. The biosphere-atmosphere coupling thereby leads to a restoration of 37\% and 48\% of the primary emissions over the industrial (A.D. 1850–2000) and the preindustrial period (A.D. 800–1850), respectively. Because of the stronger coupling flux over the preindustrial period, only 21\% of the 53 Gt C preindustrial emissions remain airborne. Despite the low airborne fraction, atmospheric CO2 rises above natural variability by late medieval times. This suggests that human influence on CO2 began prior to industrialization. Global mean temperatures, however, are not significantly altered until the strong population growth in the industrial period. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of historic events such as epidemics and warfare on the carbon budget. We find that only long-lasting events such as the Mongol invasion lead to carbon sequestration. The reason for this limited carbon sequestration is indirect emissions from past ALCC that compensate carbon uptake in regrowing vegetation for several decades. Drops in ice core CO2 are thus unlikely to be attributable to human action. Our results indicate that climate-carbon cycle studies for present and future centuries, which usually start from an equilibrium state around 1850, start from a significantly disturbed state of the carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Abstract We describe the historical evolution of the conceptualization, formulation, quantification, application, and utilization of “radiative forcing” (RF) of Earth’s climate. Basic theories of shortwave and longwave radiation were developed through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and established the analytical framework for defining and quantifying the perturbations to Earth’s radiative energy balance by natural and anthropogenic influences. The insight that Earth’s climate could be radiatively forced by changes in carbon dioxide, first introduced in the nineteenth century, gained empirical support with sustained observations of the atmospheric concentrations of the gas beginning in 1957. Advances in laboratory and field measurements, theory, instrumentation, computational technology, data, and analysis of well-mixed greenhouse gases and the global climate system through the twentieth century enabled the development and formalism of RF; this allowed RF to be related to changes in global-mean surface temperature with the aid of increasingly sophisticated models. This in turn led to RF becoming firmly established as a principal concept in climate science by 1990. The linkage with surface temperature has proven to be the most important application of the RF concept, enabling a simple metric to evaluate the relative climate impacts of different agents. The late 1970s and 1980s saw accelerated developments in quantification, including the first assessment of the effect of the forcing due to the doubling of carbon dioxide on climate (the “Charney” report). The concept was subsequently extended to a wide variety of agents beyond well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs; carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons) to short-lived species such as ozone. The WMO and IPCC international assessments began the important sequence of periodic evaluations and quantifications of the forcings by natural (solar irradiance changes and stratospheric aerosols resulting from volcanic eruptions) and a growing set of anthropogenic agents (WMGHGs, ozone, aerosols, land surface changes, contrails). From the 1990s to the present, knowledge and scientific confidence in the radiative agents acting on the climate system have proliferated. The conceptual basis of RF has also evolved as both our understanding of the way radiative forcing drives climate change and the diversity of the forcing mechanisms have grown. This has led to the current situation where “effective radiative forcing” (ERF) is regarded as the preferred practical definition of radiative forcing in order to better capture the link between forcing and global-mean surface temperature change. The use of ERF, however, comes with its own attendant issues, including challenges in its diagnosis from climate models, its applications to small forcings, and blurring of the distinction between rapid climate adjustments (fast responses) and climate feedbacks; this will necessitate further elaboration of its utility in the future. Global climate model simulations of radiative perturbations by various agents have established how the forcings affect other climate variables besides temperature (e.g., precipitation). The forcing–response linkage as simulated by models, including the diversity in the spatial distribution of forcings by the different agents, has provided a practical demonstration of the effectiveness of agents in perturbing the radiative energy balance and causing climate changes. The significant advances over the past half century have established, with very high confidence, that the global-mean ERF due to human activity since preindustrial times is positive (the 2013 IPCC assessment gives a best estimate of 2.3 W m−2, with a range from 1.1 to 3.3 W m−2; 90\% confidence interval). Further, except in the immediate aftermath of climatically significant volcanic eruptions, the net anthropogenic forcing dominates over natural radiative forcing mechanisms. Nevertheless, the substantial remaining uncertainty in the net anthropogenic ERF leads to large uncertainties in estimates of climate sensitivity from observations and in predicting future climate impacts. The uncertainty in the ERF arises principally from the incorporation of the rapid climate adjustments in the formulation, the well-recognized difficulties in characterizing the preindustrial state of the atmosphere, and the incomplete knowledge of the interactions of aerosols with clouds. This uncertainty impairs the quantitative evaluation of climate adaptation and mitigation pathways in the future. A grand challenge in Earth system science lies in continuing to sustain the relatively simple essence of the radiative forcing concept in a form similar to that originally devised, and at the same time improving the quantification of the forcing. This, in turn, demands an accurate, yet increasingly complex and comprehensive, accounting of the relevant processes in the climate system.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the ensuing debate on international negotiations aimed at limiting emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide. It maintains that a policy of target reductions in carbon dioxide emissions applied either across the board to developed countries or negotiated on a country-by-country basis is unlikely to succeed. Alternative approaches, which include carbon taxes, production quotas, and systems of tradeable or leasable emission permits are examined, with the latter option being deemed the most promising. The difficulties associated with monitoring of fossil carbon emissions and enforcement of an agreement are not thought to pose major obstacles. More serious is the problem of universality: countries which did not join a carbon abatement protocol stand to gain. Applying carbon taxes on trade with non-participants could be a legitimate and effective sanction against recalcitrant countries. However, an effective carbon abatement agreement will be extremely difficult to achieve and success is far from guaranteed. Alternatives to global agreement include regional accords, agreements between select groups of countries, and agreements on various component activities. Countries can and should also act unilaterally. 9 figs., 6 tabs.},

Après avoir exposé l’histoire de ce concept et les multiples réalités qu’il recouvre, cette recherche s’attache à examiner comment cette forme de tourisme s’est rapidement développée à La Nouvelle-Orléans après le passage de l’ouragan Katrina, le 29 août 2005. Il s’agit ici d’analyser les enjeux multiples et parfois conflictuels de ces pratiques, à travers l’étude des motivations et des interactions entre les différents acteurs de ce tourisme macabre. Ce dernier participe en effet de la patrimonialisation des espaces affectés par la catastrophe, mais ce faisant, il met également en lumière les enjeux politiques, sociaux et culturels, liés à l’interprétation de l’événement et aux discours sur la reconstruction de la ville. Les nécessités économiques et l’horizon d’attente des touristes par rapport aux représentations de La Nouvelle-Orléans dans la conscience collective américaine conduisent ainsi à la construction d’une mémoire sélective de la catastrophe. Cela se traduit par une surreprésentation de certains lieux et, corrélativement, par un manque de visibilité d’autres espaces dont les besoins peinent à accéder à la sphère publique.},

	url = {http://www.theses.fr/s131045},
	abstract = {Cette thèse propose une géographie des lieux de mémoire du Sud du Liban entre 1978 et 2018. Cette région a été marquée par une occupation militaire israélienne (1978-2000) et est soumise à une hégémonie politique, partagée concurremment entre deux partis politiques chiites, le Hezbollah et le mouvement Amal. Dans un contexte de faiblesse de l'État, ces partis font du Sud un étendard de la Résistance. À partir d'une enquête qualitative, la recherche fait dialoguer des modalités de spatialisation des traces mémorielles à l'issue de l'occupation israélienne. Les mises en mémoire de l'ancienne prison de Khiyâm et du château de Shaqîf-Beaufort participent de la production de lieux institués, objets de processus visibles et institutionnalisés. Tenaces, les lieux de mémoire hérités de l'occupation israélienne, conceptualisés sous la notion de lieux-fantômes, désignent, quant à eux, les lieux hantés par les traces de passés conflictuels. Par ailleurs, une nébuleuse d'acteurs mémoriels mineurs (artistes et militants notamment), dont certains sont invisibilisés, développe une stratégie de production d'images territoriales, qui projettent une certaine représentation du passé et du patrimoine fantasmés du Sud du Liban et celle d'un espace-temps potentiel. Malgré des conditions de visibilité différenciées et des mises en scène concurrentielles, tous ces lieux, signes et objets de mémoire, dans leur pluralité, contribuent à la construction du Sud comme une métonymie. Au sein de cet espace de croyances, les lieux de mémoire constituent une arène dans laquelle chaque acteur tente d'imposer des pratiques, des imaginaires, des valeurs et des normes fantasmés, inscrits dans un registre d'appropriation, de légitimation et de reconnaissance.},

	abstract = {Societies that have undergone systemic change are characterized as ‘post’—post-socialist, post-colonial, etc.—to encapsulate the impact the past still has on their structure and functioning. Research on these societies has therefore tended to adopt a mostly temporal approach, investigating the tension between continuity and change. Using the example of post-apartheid South Africa, I make a case for a more balanced approach to post situations by including space as equally valuable. I draw my theoretical inspiration from Hartog’s notion of regimes of historicity and Massey’s space-time to argue that we should investigate space-time regimes. I show that a space-time regime of entanglement, often passéist, with blurred temporal boundaries and messy, place-bound experiences of time, characterizes post situations. Finally, using South Africa as my empirical grounding, I offer a set of metaphors to describe and analyze the concrete places that this entangled, post space-time produces.},

	abstract = {Focusing on Cape Town, this article investigates how financialization unfolds in the South African housing market. I use a mixed method that combines in-depth field research conducted among key market players with an analysis of georeferenced residential transactions. Connecting financial and urban geography, the article retraces the institutional and social anatomy of financialization. I demonstrate how financialization unfolds in metropolitan areas through the classification of people and the selection of spaces, by staying away from the urban poor, and instead incorporating the middle- and upper-income sections of society. In that regard, the article unpacks the urban and class structures of housing financialization in South Africa, which challenges narratives from the urban Global North. Two market segments drive financialization in South Africa: the rental market, which became a new financial frontier with the emergence of corporate landlords; and the owner-occupied market, with the rise of the mortgage industry and the limited implementation of securitization, underpinned by highly restrictive lending practices. In both segments, financial institutions and corporate landlords rely on credit scoring to classify and select tenants or mortgage beneficiaries; they target specific areas within the post-apartheid city to develop residential portfolios and allocate mortgages.},

Pourtant, en Afrique du Sud en général, et à Johannesburg en particulier, l’art public ne naît pas avec la fin de l’apartheid. La ville doit en effet également s’occuper de l’art public hérité de la période précédente. Dans un tel contexte de réinvention urbaine, il s’agit de s’interroger sur la place de cet héritage « encombrant » dans le Johannesburg contemporain, et sur sa capacité à faire patrimoine. L’étude d’une des œuvres emblématiques de l’apartheid permet de montrer que cet art public est aujourd’hui au cœur de différentes formes de réappropriations, institutionnelles ou non, qui questionnent les notions mêmes de patrimoine et de patrimonialisation. Ces réappropriations, parfois conflictuelles, sont révélatrices des enjeux symboliques qui entourent cet héritage, mais aussi de la volonté de la récente autorité métropolitaine d’asseoir, par la patrimonialisation, sa légitimité sur la ville et dans la ville.},

Tous légitiment ce déplacement en mobilisant deux catégories principales d’arguments : la conservation patrimoniale et le développement économique. En rumeur depuis les années 1960, le resettlement de Lalibela débute réellement en 2009, à la faveur d’un accord entre la Banque mondiale et le gouvernement éthiopien pour le développement du tourisme durable en Éthiopie. Commence alors une mise en œuvre brutale et heurtée, donnant à voir des relations de pouvoir instables entre les habitants, les pouvoirs publics et ecclésiastiques éthiopiens, et les acteurs internationaux. En analysant les discours et les pratiques de ces acteurs tout au long de la construction du resettlement et des premiers temps de sa mise en œuvre, nous proposons une réflexion actuelle sur la restructuration urbaine par « destruction créatrice » dans une petite ville d’Éthiopie.},

Initiée dans le cadre d’un projet de la MSH Paris Nord intitulé « De la mémoire aux territoires : interroger la fabrique des lieux de mobilité », cette recherche porte plus précisément sur la question des lieux que ces mobilités touristico-religieuses concourent à produire en s’intéressant à la fois aux pratiques qu’ils suscitent et à la dimension matérielle de ces derniers. Un terrain exploratoire en 2016 en Israël – un espace d’observation privilégié par l’omniprésence du religieux, sa diversité et ses effets particulièrement structurants sur l’espace – a montré comment, s’y déployant spatialement, pèlerinages et tourisme religieux participent non seulement à produire des lieux, mais également à produire différents types de lieux. Trois de ces « lieux de mobilité » ont été identifiés : des lieux de pèlerinage, des lieux de substitution construits pour pallier la difficulté d’accéder à certains lieux saints et, plus surprenant, des parcs à thème religieux. Ce constat pose la question des processus, des acteurs et des modalités de production de ces lieux de nature différente. Il pose également la question des circulations entre ces lieux et de la circulation des lieux eux-mêmes, c’est-à-dire de leur « translation » par-delà les frontières nationales d’un territoire israélo-palestinien que l’on peut alors réinscrire dans l’espace des mobilités internationales et de la transnationalisation des pratiques et des lieux qu’il induit.},

Des groupes citoyens revendiquent de plus en plus leurs droits culturels et politiques, prétendent à une certaine visibilité dans l'espace public et tentent d'investir les villes par leurs modes de vie spécifiques. Le « droit à la ville », qui se nourrit du concept de justice spatiale, amène les citoyens à refuser de se laisser écarter de la réalité urbaine par des logiques discriminatoires, inégalitaires et ségrégatives. Ce renouvellement de l'investissement politique des espaces urbains est au cœur de ce livre. À partir d'exemples recueillis dans des villes du monde entier (en Argentine, Inde, Turquie, Bulgarie, France...), des chercheurs interrogent les obstacles à la citoyenneté, mais aussi l'expression politique relative à cette citoyenneté, notamment à partir des affirmations et revendications identitaires contemporaines. Ils analysent les effets de la montée des identités collectives (ethniques, culturelles, religieuses...) sur la citoyenneté et, plus largement, sur les démocraties dites représentatives.

	abstract = {Le vie di Napoli sono costellate da numerose opere d’arte urbana che riattualizzano, quasi ossessivamente, segni e simboli prelevati dal Cristianesimo e dalla cultura barocca. Dagli anni Novanta a oggi, artisti come cyop\&kaf, Jorit, Pignon-Ernest, Mandragora e altri rappresentano i culti devozionali dei napoletani, ispirandosi alle stratificazioni “porose” di una città in cui coesistono cultura alta e bassa, pubblico e privato, legalità e illegalità, antico e contemporaneo. L’intreccio di Storia dell’arte, Antropologia e Semiotica permette di comparare diversi murales e serigrafie ad alcuni elementi della fede come i pantheon di fotografie e di statuette delle anime purganti, il corpo frammentato della reliquia e del Trickster, la commistione di ironico e di tragico delle micro-architetture votive, le icone cristiane.},

La technique consiste à asphyxier des personnes réfugiées ou enfermées dans une grotte, en allumant devant l'entrée des feux qui consomment l'oxygène disponible et remplissent les cavités de fumée.

Or, il n’en est rien et le renouveau historiographique sur l’histoire des Empires en témoigne.
Mais si le sentiment est ainsi bien ancré, c’est aussi que les représentations visuelles de ces guerres lointaines sont beaucoup plus rares, même si c’est juste avant la guerre de Sécession qu’apparaissent les premières images photographiques de morts sur le terrain avec Jules Couppier lors de la guerre d’Italie (1859) et Felice Beato, durant la seconde guerre de l’Opium (1860).},

Reflections on this anniversary should serve to recall the contestations through which this foundational institution was formed, and the delegate dynamics that continue to be reproduced in its wake. The contentious debates and political dynamics that afflicted the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee tasked with crafting the Framework Convention on Climate Change, as well as dissension in the periphery, remain as relevant today as they were three decades ago. Reprising these dynamics through detailed historical and archival analysis, this article excavates the negotiations of the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee, which met in 5 sessions during 1991–1992. The aim is to identify key fault-lines and conflicts in the lead-up to the finalization of the 1992 Convention, in order to demonstrate whose epistemic and normative commitments came to be reflected in the final outcome and to show how the legacy of this process endures to date. I seek to render visible actors and proposals peripheralized in the formation of planetary climate governance to extrapolate normative boundaries and proffer heterodox lessons from the margins.},

	abstract = {RésuméLa notion de modification coercitive du peuplement (MCP) fait référence aux facteurs politiques qui agissent sur la répartition de la population dans l'espace. Ces facteurs, souvent et improprement présentés comme « historiques », peuvent être regroupés en cinq types fondamentaux : colonisation, expulsion, ségrégation, refoulement et extermination. La colonisation transforme le peuplement par ajout d?une population nouvelle. La ségrégation impose une séparation entre groupes prédéfinis, et généralement une résidence à un groupe dominé. Le refoulement interdit à des personnes données l'accès à un territoire. L?expulsion engendre soit des personnes déplacées (à l'intérieur des frontières de leur État d?origine), soit des réfugiés (à l'extérieur des frontières de leur État d?origine). Enfin, l'extermination transforme le peuplement par disparition plus ou moins poussée d?un groupe prédéfini. Le terme de génocide renvoie à des cas d?extermination poussée. Tous ces facteurs agissent de manière concomitante ou progressive. Une fois un groupe défini, il peut être soumis à une ségrégation, expulsé, ou victime de massacres, sinon d?un génocide. Expulsion et massacre sont ainsi concomitants dans le nettoyage ethnique. L?impact de la MCP est souvent significatif, c?est pourquoi elle doit être reconnue en tant que telle et examinée avec soin par les géographes.},

What has happened, what does it mean, and what comes next? In order to consider the future of Syria, it is crucial to assess not only what has been destroyed, but also how it was destroyed. It is equally vital to address the structural and possibly enduring results of large-scale destruction and displacement. These dynamics are not only at play in Syrian society, but are tearing at the economic fabric and very territorial integrity of the country. If war is a powerful process of human and material destruction, it is equally a powerful process of spatial, social and economic reconfiguration. Nor does it stop at national borders--the unravelling of Syria, and of the idea of Syria, has affected and will continue to affect the entire Middle East. 'War-Torn' explores these transformations and the processes that fuel them. It is an indispensable account throwing light on neglected aspects of the Syrian war, and a much-needed contribution to our understanding of conflicts in the twenty-first century.},

L’étude géographique offre une analyse des mouvements des demandeurs d’asile selon des emboîtements dans le temps et dans l’espace, tout en reflétant le vécu des demandeurs d’asile et les contradictions du milieu d’accueil. La première partie s’intéresse au flux de demandeurs d’asile sur la période 1994-2005, elle fait ressortir les grandes tendances d’un flux très majoritairement européen orienté Est-Ouest, mais aussi les fluctuations dans la composition nationale et régionale des origines des migrants. La seconde partie de l’article revient sur la géographie administrative des structures dédiées à l’accueil des demandeurs d’asile dans l’agglomération lyonnaise, structures qui dessinent de nouvelles centralités urbaines. Enfin, l’article met en relief la mobilité du demandeur d’asile dans l’agglomération, nomade urbain, qui investit parfois des espaces publics centraux au point de les transformer en « points chauds », comme ce fut le cas pour la place Carnot au début des années 2000.},

These are then sent in digitally to a central unit at the European Commission, and automatically checked against other prints on the database. This enables authorities to determine whether asylum seekers have already applied for asylum in another EU member state or have illegally transited through another EU member state ("principle of first contact"). The Automated Fingerprint Identification System is the first of its kind on the European Union level and has been operating since 15 January 2003. All EU member states currently participate in the scheme, plus three additional European countries: Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.},

	abstract = {La surveillance des frontières s’est muée ces dernières années en un business hautement profitable. Les sociétés privées de sécurité autant que celles de l’industrie de l’armement en savent quelque chose : depuis le milieu des années 1990, elles ont trouvé dans ce nouveau « créneau » des opportunités inespérées. La plus grosse entreprise de sécurité, G4S (dont une partie de l’activité est consacrée à la « gestion » de l’immigration), emploie aujourd’hui près de 650 000 salariés, ce qui en fait le deuxième plus grand employeur privé du monde. Jamais, en effet, les politiques sécuritaires n’ont aussi fructueusement dopé le marché. FRONTEX, l’agence européenne des frontières mise en place par l’UE, est emblématique de ce boom – politiquement rentable et financièrement profitable, bien au-delà des pays du Nord.
La Libye, avec ou sans Kadhafi, a su habilement tirer profit de la manne des migrants, ces derniers faisant l’objet d’infinis marchandages avec les capitales européennes. En Israël comme aux États-Unis, la construction de centres de détention pour étrangers et de murs, censés rendre étanches les frontières, se révèle un pactole pour l’économie locale. C’est aussi une façon efficace de conforter les angoisses et de nourrir les fantasmes xénophobes qui font le miel de certains politiciens.
Du Sénégal à la frontière mexicaine, de Kiev à Paris ou Tel-Aviv, les rouages invisibles de cette nouvelle ruée vers l’or sont, pour la première fois, mis en lumière et analysés dans ce livre détonnant.},

Correction at 4:55, the narration should say "counterclockwise rotation gives positive curl, clockwise rotation gives negative curl".  The diagram is correct, though.

	abstract = {Fossil fuel power plants generate significant amounts of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, which are believed to be the main cause of climate change. Among CO2 mitigation options, carbon capture and storage is considered the only technology that can significantly reduce the emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion sources. There are mainly three technological routes for CO2 capture from power plants: post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion. Unfortunately, their application may reduce the net efficiency of a plant by up to 14\% points and increase the cost of electricity by 30-70\%. This paper briefly reviews the performance of power plants with carbon capture, and presents current research and development, and demonstration activities on CCS.},

	abstract = {While adaptation has, in the last 3 years, become the most fashionable item on the climate policy agenda, this was not always so. Since the early 1990s, numerous scientists and policy makers have been making the case that adaptation has been the overlooked cousin of greenhouse gas mitigation. As both are seen to be of equal importance, the lack of policy on adaptation is interpreted as a political strategy by developed countries to avoid admitting liability and the financial consequences of this admission. A tension between those in favour of mitigation over adaptation activities has strongly characterized the discourse on climate change policy. However, a closer look at the history of the concept of adaptation as applied in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process underscores the original intention that the treaty should focus on reducing the source of climate change, rather than on adapting to the changes. Adaptive capacity was considered to be an indicator of the extent to which societies could tolerate changes in climate, and was not seen as a policy objective. As a result of events that have unrolled since the inception of the UNFCCC, needs and perceptions have shifted. Today, there are strong grounds for having adaptation as a policy goal, but it must be recognized that the UNFCCC, and its Kyoto Protocol in particular, are first and foremost about abating greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, adaptation policy may find a more appropriate home beyond the existing climate change regime.},

	abstract = {Résumé :         Cet article est une étude sociopoétique de L’Amie prodigieuse (2011), roman de         l’auteure italienne Elena Ferrante. La ville de Naples étant notre         objet d’étude, il s’agit de déchiffrer le monde selon la perspective         de la narratrice, Elena Greco, afin de comprendre la sémiotisation du         quartier (le rione         italien). Ce dernier, comme évoqué dans le titre du présent         article, est représenté comme « un gouffre d’où il était illusoire         d’essayer de sortir ». Pour illustrer ce concept, nous allons d’abord         mettre en évidence la littérarité et l’évolution intellectuelle         d’Elena Greco en explorant les clins d’œil du roman à la littérature         virgilienne. Ces intertextes sont en fait révélateurs de certains         aspects de l’histoire napolitaine et, plus particulièrement, de l’idée         que le rione représente         tous les aspects négatifs de Naples, un lieu érigé en mythe comme une         ville condamnée. Ensuite, nous enquêterons sur la division symbolique         de l’identité d’Elena : d’une part, elle vient d’un milieu violent,         vulgaire et gouverné par la mafia et, d’autre part, elle est une jeune         femme éduquée qui s’inspire de la littérature et de l’histoire. Cette         division identitaire reflète sa perception que la ville, elle aussi,         est divisée en deux : le rione dans lequel elle vit est sale et         terni par la violence, ce qui contredit l’au-delà « miraculeux » du         rione lié à la plage, à         l’éducation, à la langue italienne et à la mouvance socioéconomique du         pays au milieu du XXe         siècle. La ville au-delà du rione anticipe le fait que, dans les romans         successifs, Elena réussit à fuir du « gouffre ».},

In contrast, since the Greco-Roman era, volcanoes have featured among the favourite sites for people colonizing the Campania region. The stable settlements around Vesuvius, Campi Flegrei caldera and Ischia were progressively enlarged, attaining a maximum growth rate between 1950 and 1980. Between 1982 and 1984, Neapolitans faced the last and most dramatic volcanic crises, which occurred at Campi Flegrei (Pozzuoli) without an eruption. Since that time, volcanologists have focused their attention on the problem of risks associated with eruptions in the Neapolitan area, but a systematic strategy to reduce the very high volcanic risk of this zone is still lacking. A brief history of volcanic risk in the Neapolitan district is narrated here in an effort to provide new food for thought for the scientific community that works for the mitigation of volcanic risk in this area.},

The problems of the city have different origins, recent or not. Currently the two main critical factors derive from the social and economic conditions of its wider metropolitan area and from the lack of a clear functional distribution between city and its surrounding area; the result is a strong concentration of key functions in the city and the unplanned diffusion of residential areas and secondary functions far beyond its boundaries. Naples recent fast transition to a post-industrial condition (without having gone through a strong industrial stage) has forced a profound re-examination of its future and has driven planning policies towards ambitious urban plans; but the weakness of a strong social and economic structure has called into question both the assumptions and the targets of the city’s planners.},

Previous critiques have focused on the actions of the Government of Italy and the Department of Civil Protection (Protezione Civile), with little attention paid to the role of local authorities. This analysis sheds light on how the latter used emergency powers, the command-and-control approach, and top-down planning to manage the disaster context, especially in terms of removal of rubble, implementing safety measures, and allocating temporary accommodation. It discusses how these arrangements constituted the mechanism via which ‘disaster capitalism’ took hold at the local and national level, and how it violated human rights, produced environmental and social impacts, hindered local communities from learning, transforming, and building resilience, and facilitated disaster capitalism and corruption. To make the disaster risk reduction and resilience paradigm more effective, a shift from centralised civil protection to decentralised, inclusive community empowerment systems is needed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Italian mafias—Cosa Nostra, Camorra, and ‘Ndrangheta—are long-lived, resilient organizations that have evolved to adapt to environmental changes. They have different organizational models. While Cosa Nostra (in the past) and ‘Ndrangheta are characterized by a unitary, vertical structure and higher-level coordination bodies, Camorra has a plurality of organizational models; the majority of clans maintain a structure that is fluid, polycentric, and conflictual. In general, mafias with a vertical organizational order have greater control over conflict, and greater capacity to resist state power. The ‘Ndrangheta has become the richest and most powerful of the three, replacing Cosa Nostra in international drug trafficking. It is able to reproduce its organizational structures and business model in new territories in Italy and elsewhere. In contrast, owing to unprecedented law enforcement efforts in recent decades, Cosa Nostra is weaker, down but not out. Camorra continues to be the most violent mafia, committing more homicides than the other two combined. Consistent with their adaptive capacity, mafias in new areas of expansion are treated as novel agents that can provide extralegal services and business opportunities. They are sought out by entrepreneurs, white-collar professionals, and local politicians to solve problems such as debt collection, labor unrest, and disputes with suppliers.},

Against this superimposition, the author's contention is twofold: (1) The supply of illegal commodities mainly takes place in a `disorganized' way and, due to the constraints of product illegality, no immanent tendency towards the development of large-scale criminal enterprises within illegal markets exist. (2) Some lasting large-scale criminal organizations do exist, but they are neither exclusively involved in illegal market activities, nor is their development and internal configuration the result of illegal market dynamics.For Susan Strange: mentor and friend},

	abstract = {High risk volcanic events are commonly preceded by long periods of unrest during which scientists are asked to provide near real-time forecasts. The rarity of such events, inaccessibility of the underground volcanic system, non-linear behaviors, and limited datasets constitute major sources of uncertainty. In order to provide reasoned guidance in the face of uncertainties, monitoring observations and conceptual/theoretical models must be incorporated into a formal and structured probabilistic scheme using evidence science principles. As uncertainty and subjectivity are inescapable components of volcanic hazard forecasts, they must be dealt with and clearly communicated to decision-makers and society. Here, we present the set-up of an automated near-real-time tool for short-term eruption forecasting for Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc), Italy. The tool, based on a Bayesian Event Tree scheme, takes account of all the available information, and subjectivity of choices is dealt through a 5-year-long elicitation experiment with a team of about 30 of the major experts of the geological history, dynamics and monitoring of CFc. The tool provides prompt probabilistic assessment in near real-time, making it particularly suitable for tracking a rapidly evolving crisis, and it is easily reviewable once new observations and/or models become available. The quantitative rules behind the tool, which represent the group view of the elicited community of experts, are defined during a period of quiescence, thus allowing prior scrutiny of any scientific input into the model, and minimizing the external stress on scientists during an actual emergency phase. Notably, the results also show that CFc may pose a higher threat to the city of Naples than the better-known Mount Vesuvius.},

	abstract = {The Department of Civil Protection (DPC), in compliance with the EU decision 1313/2013 and at the request of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 to update the disaster risk assessments by various countries, released the latest National Risk Assessment for Italy at the end of 2018. Specifically, as regards the seismic risk assessment, six research units belonging to two centres of competence of the DPC collaborated under its guidance to update the risk maps of the Italian residential heritage. This extensive collaboration complied with the recent Italian code for Civil Protection, which requires a broad scientific consensus for risk assessment. During this research activity, six fragility models were developed, according to some common criteria (four for masonry buildings and two for RC buildings). These models were then implemented by the DPC for the definition of the national seismic risk. Within this context, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the risk results provided by these models, compare their features, and assess and validate their prediction capabilities. In particular, this paper shows the comparison of predicted and observed damage scenarios and consequences on building stock and the population of two seismic events, i.e. L’Aquila 2009 and Amatrice 2016. Furthermore, the paper provides some interesting damage and risk predictions at a national level. Overall, the forecasts and comparisons made in this study demonstrate the validity of the approach adopted by the DPC for the assessment of national seismic risk.},

	abstract = {Understanding how natural processes may turn into disasters represents a key aspect to the implementation of effective risk reduction strategies. Within this framework, the current study aimed to document positive and negative experiences related to one of the deadliest landslide disasters in Italy, in which 160 people lost their lives, 115 were injured, and 1210 became homeless. The disaster took place on May 5, 1998, after nine days of continuous rainfall, in five towns of the Campania region (southern Italy) which were struck by hundreds of shallow land­ slides that evolved into rapid and extremely rapid debris/hyperconcentrated flows. Our analysis focused on the early response phase of the disaster, and highlighted numerous human short­ comings which amplified the impact on the population. The human loss was relatively contained by a reactive behavior of many citizens that as soon after the first flows, occurred in the afternoon of May 5, left their houses.We also provided a summary of non-structural prevention measures prompted by the disaster that were realized at the national scale during the next 23 years, together with useful findings for evaluating their effectiveness. Some criticisms affecting the policies in effect were also discussed. Information and examples reported in the current study may assist with the development and implementation of geo-hydrological risk mitigation strategies in other parts of the world, since landslide disasters similar to the one described in this article continue to occur worldwide.},

	abstract = {Under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) countries have sovereign rights over their genetic resources. Agreements governing the access to these resources and the sharing of the benefits arising from their use need to be established between involved parties [i.e. Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS)]. This also applies to species collected for potential use in biological control. Recent applications of CBD principles have already made it difficult or impossible to collect and export natural enemies for biological control research in several countries. If such an approach is widely applied it would impede this very successful and environmentally safe pest management method based on the use of biological diversity. The CBD is required to agree a comprehensive Access and Benefit Sharing process in 2010, in preparation for which the IOBC (International Organization for Biological Control of Noxious Animals and Plants) Global Commission on Biological Control and Access and Benefit Sharing has prepared this position paper. Here, we first describe the practice of biological control in relation to the principles of ABS, illustrated extensively by case studies and successes obtained with biological control. Next, we emphasise the very limited monetary benefits generated in biological control when compared to other fields of ABS such as the collection of germplasm for development of human drugs, chemical pesticides or crop cultivars. Subsequently, we inform the biological control community of good ABS practice and challenges, and we hope to make clear to the community involved in ABS under the CBD the special situation with regard to biological control. Finally, based on the non-commercial academic research model, we make recommendations which would facilitate the practice of collection and exchange of biological control agents, propose a workable framework to assist policy makers and biological control practitioners, and urge biological control leaders in each country to get involved in the discussions with their national ABS contact point to take their needs into consideration.},

In this work, we reviewed and systematically coded 138 ILK conservation initiatives published in academic papers in order to explore trends in participation, digitalization, timing, location, and approach of the initiatives. We also explored factors influencing initiative inclusiveness. Our findings reveal that ILK holders are generally absent from most phases of the studied initiatives, although IT-based and in situ initiatives (i.e., education and community based conservation) appear as the exceptions. We also found that ex situ initiatives (i.e., research/documentation and policy/legislation efforts) are predominant, despite the challenges they reportedly face. These findings call for re-formulating the ways in which ex situ ILK conservation is done and for supporting in situ and IT based initiatives, as they offer the potential to lead the participatory turn.},

	abstract = {The knowledge, values, and practices of Indigenous peoples and local communities offer ways to understand and better address social-environmental problems. The article reviews the state of the literature on this topic by focusing on six pathways by which Indigenous peoples and local communities engage with management of and relationships to nature. These are (a) undertaking territorial management practices and customary governance, (b) contributing to nature conservation and restoration efforts with regional to global implications, (c) co-constructing knowledge for assessments and monitoring, (d) countering the drivers of unsustainable resource use and resisting environmental injustices, (e) playing key roles in environmental governance across scales, and ( f ) offering alternative conceptualizations of the interrelations between people and nature. The review shows that through these pathways Indigenous peoples and local communities are making significant contributions to managing the health of local and regional ecosystems, to producing knowledge based in diverse values of nature, confronting societal pressures and environmental burdens, and leading and partnering in environmental governance. These contributions have local to global implications but have yet to be fully recognized in conservation and development polices, and by society at large.},

	abstract = {The concepts of Open Educational Resources (OER) and Open Educational Practices (OEP), regarded as two pillars of the broader open education movement, have been evolving since the concept of OER was first coined in the 2012 Paris Declaration. Several research studies have been conducted to investigate the impacts of OER and OEP adoption and implementation in universities. However, most of those studies have focused on western and developed countries, and little information is known about developing countries, especially Asian ones. Particularly, China was one of the first Asian countries to adopt open education and its related strategies following the MIT OpenCourseWare conference in Beijing in 2003. This study conducts a systematic literature review to investigate the current state of the art of OER and OEP in China. The findings show that several governmental, organizational, and institutional initiatives have been launched to facilitate OER adoption in China. They also show that while several OEPs have been implemented, there is still a continuous need to work on these practices and further investigate their impacts on learning outcomes and behaviors, as no current reviewed study has done so. Finally, a generic framework of OER and OEP challenges is presented along with recommendations to further enhance the adoption of OER and OEP in China.},

Among those emphasised by the SDGs, some are highly relevant for indigenous groups. Education, poverty, access to justice and climate change are only a few of the issues affecting indigenous people’s lives. Yet, indigenous groups are not passive actors. Despite being at the mercy of climate hazards and misleading political decisions, the knowledge system they have developed throughout the centuries has helped them to successfully respond to ecological and development challenges. By exploring indigenous cultures and their knowledge systems in greater depth, this article aims to understand how the sustainable development agenda can benefit from these different forms of traditional knowledge. More particularly, it will attempt to explain the main notions in which traditional knowledge is rooted and analyse means of knowledge maintenance and transmission. It will then explore the relationship between indigenous knowledge, sustainable practices and land and resource management, as well as climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies. These ideas will be supported by a discussion on the need to guarantee indigenous people full access to land and justice in order for them to fully realise their rights. The conclusion reflects on the importance of fostering an integrated system of knowledge in which indigenous groups are involved in knowledge sharing practices and decision making processes.},

Future leaders must make decisions from an informed position and the public will need to embed climate change mitigation tools into their work and private life. It is therefore essential to understand the range of CCE strategies being taken globally by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and to explore and analyse the ways that HEIs could better address this challenge. Consistent with this research need, this paper offers an analysis of the extent to which HEIs in 45 countries approach CCE and provides a conceptual framework for exploring how HEIs are embedding CCE into their curricula. In addition to the specialist approach (where students choose to study a degree to become experts in climate change adaptation and mitigation tools), the CCE framework developed identifies and highlights three other approaches HEIs can deploy to embed CCE: Piggybacking, mainstreaming and connecting (transdisciplinary). Using data gathered in an explorative international survey involving participants working across academic and senior management, this paper illustrates the different approaches taken and analyses practical examples of current CCE practice from across the world. Responses from 212 university staff from 45 countries indicated that CCE was highly variable – no clear pattern was identified at the country level, with CCE approaches varying significantly, even within individual HEIs. This plurality highlights the wide range of ideas and examples being shared and used by institutions in very different countries and contexts, and underlines the importance of the independence and autonomy of HEIs so that they can choose the right CCE approaches for them. To highlight the breadth and variety of approaches that were uncovered by our survey, the paper offers a range of examples illustrating how climate change education may be embedded in a higher education context, some of which could be replicated in HEIs across the world. The conceptualisation of CCE and the examples given in this paper are valuable for anyone who is thinking about strategies for embedding more climate education in the higher education curriculum.},

In this paper the authors discuss how open and flexible learning can apply its strengths in the area of widening participation, as it can lever years of experience with non-traditional target groups. They show how flexible learning universities, such as Open Universities, may offer their curriculum as open educational resource (OER) for these types of learning and can indeed contribute for achieving such a needed critical mass. Mass education of this type may have a key role to play in meeting any global challenge, and climate change is no exception. In this paper, the authors exemplify it through an exploration of a partnership project between eight European universities in developing the LECH-e materials for a Master’s curriculum on the lived experiences of climate change.},

Education stakeholders in many countries have yet to develop a coherent framework for climate change education (CCE).

It provides rationales as to why CCE should be addressed in the context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Advancing CCE in the context of ESD, or Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development (CCESD), requires enhancement of learners’ understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change and their readiness to take actions to address it.

This analysis traces emissions totaling 914 GtCO2e—63 \% of cumulative worldwide emissions of industrial CO2 and methane between 1751 and 2010—to the 90 “carbon major” entities based on the carbon content of marketed hydrocarbon fuels (subtracting for non-energy uses), process CO2 from cement manufacture, CO2 from flaring, venting, and own fuel use, and fugitive or vented methane. Cumulatively, emissions of 315 GtCO2e have been traced to investor-owned entities, 288 GtCO2e to state-owned enterprises, and 312 GtCO2e to nation-states. Of these emissions, half has been emitted since 1986. The carbon major entities possess fossil fuel reserves that will, if produced and emitted, intensify anthropogenic climate change. The purpose of the analysis is to understand the historic emissions as a factual matter, and to invite consideration of their possible relevance to public policy.},

IASC does not endorse any one definition of the Arctic region. There are many different definitions – astronomical, political, meteorological, ecological, and more. Natural systems do not reflect geopolitical boundaries, and often neither do social systems follow such drawn lines. The extent of the Arctic is flexible, dynamic, and context-specific. 
Furthermore, in defining Indigeneity, self-identification of Arctic Indigenous Peoples and groups is the appropriate and accepted standard. Recognition of Indigenous groups at some level (regionally, nationally, internationally, etc.) and expression of interest in IASC’s mission is sufficient for inclusion in the IASC community. 
It is important to acknowledge that Traditional Knowledge, Indigenous Knowledge, and scientific knowledge1 are coequal and complementary knowledge systems. With its recommendations, the IASC Action Group on Indigenous Involvement (AGII; see Appendix for AGII Process) encourages and aims to facilitate cooperation in all aspects of Arctic research, Indigenous Knowledge, and knowledge co-production in all countries engaged in Arctic research and in all areas of the Arctic.},

	abstract = {The basic component of any country’s agricultural knowledge system is its agricultural indigenous knowledge (AIK). It encompasses the skills, experiences and insights of people, applied to maintain or improve their livelihood. Regrettably, today, many AIK systems are at risk of becoming extinct because of rapidly changing natural environments and fast pacing economic, political, and cultural changes on a global scale. Practices vanish if not documented and this curtails knowledge growth. Sometimes, many AIK practices disappear only because of the intrusion of foreign technologies that promise short-term gains or solutions. The tragedy of the impending disappearance of AIK is most obvious to those who have developed it and make a living through it. But the implication for others can be detrimental as well, when skills, technologies, artifacts, problem solving strategies and expertise are lost. Because of the worry for the extinction of AIK, this study was instituted to document AIK among rural communities in three districts in Uganda and design an online platform for accessibility.},

This study uncovers the potential of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) from the perspective of indigenous communities in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, and explores how TEK helps them to observe and respond to local climate change. Data were collected through interviews and field work observations and analysed using thematic analysis based on the TEK framework. The results indicated that these communities have observed a significant increase in temperature, with uncertain weather and seasons. Consequently, drought and wildfires have had a substantial impact on their livelihoods. However, they have responded to this by managing their customary land and resources to ensure food and resource security, which provides a respectable example of the sustainable management of terrestrial and inland ecosystems. The social networks and institutions of indigenous communities enable collective action which strengthens the reciprocal relationships that they rely on when calamity strikes. Accordingly, the communities maintain their TEK through cultural festivals and oral traditions passed from one generation to another. TEK is a practical tool that helps indigenous communities adapt to climate risks and promotes socio-ecological resilience, which upholds social empowerment and sustainable resource management.},

	abstract = {To address global environmental challenges it is crucial to understand how humans make decisions about environmentally relevant behaviour, since a shift to alternative behaviours can make a relevant difference. This paper proposes a comprehensive model of determinants of individual environmentally relevant behaviour based on a combination of the most common theories in environmental psychology. The model is tested using a meta-analytical structural equation modelling approach based on a pool of 56 different data sets with a variety of target behaviours. The model is supported by the data. Intentions to act, perceived behavioural control and habits were identified as direct predictors of behaviour. Intentions are predicted by attitudes, personal and social norms, and perceived behavioural control. Personal norms are predicted by social norms, perceived behavioural control, awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, an ecological world view and self-transcendence values. Selfenhancement values have a negative impact on personal norms. Based on the model, interventions to change behaviour need not only to include attitude campaigns but also a focus on de-habitualizing behaviour, strengthening the social support and increasing self-efficacy by concrete information about how to act. Value based interventions have only an indirect effect.},

However, proponents and critics of Hardin’s thesis continue to argue that open access to common-pool resources inevitably leads to a tragedy of the commons. A longitudinal study that we conducted of pastoral mobility and primary production in the Logone floodplain in the Far North Region of Cameroon suggest that open access does not have to lead to a tragedy of the commons. We argue that this pastoral system is best conceptualized as an open system, in which a combination of individual decision-making and coordination of movements leads to an ideal-free type of distribution of mobile pastoralists.

	abstract = {The theory of planned behavior (TPB) allows researchers to identify the determinants of environmental behavior and subsequently target these factors in interventions. Multiple studies on conservation behaviors have recently applied this theoretical framework in both organizational and domestic settings. To shed more light on how the TPB was used in these studies, we conducted a literature review with the following objectives: 1) explore which individual green behaviors were studied though the lens of the TPB, 2) understand how scholars have used the theory and what variance the theory has helped to explain, and 3) formulate recommendations, if necessary, for improving the use of the theory. The review of the results from 126 publications demonstrated that the majority of scholars tend to overlook the importance of identifying and evaluating indirect variables (beliefs) that affect behaviors. More than half of the analyzed articles did not report the amount of explained variance, which undermines the principal strength of the theory. Scholars could obtain more substantial and consistent results if the guidelines regarding the application of the theory are consistently respected. More specifically, four aspects should be considered in the application of the theory: choice of framework, decision to extend the original model, methodology, and results.

	abstract = {To address global environmental challenges it is crucial to understand how humans make decisions about environmentally relevant behaviour, since a shift to alternative behaviours can make a relevant difference. This paper proposes a comprehensive model of determinants of individual environmentally relevant behaviour based on a combination of the most common theories in environmental psychology. The model is tested using a meta-analytical structural equation modelling approach based on a pool of 56 different data sets with a variety of target behaviours. The model is supported by the data. Intentions to act, perceived behavioural control and habits were identified as direct predictors of behaviour. Intentions are predicted by attitudes, personal and social norms, and perceived behavioural control. Personal norms are predicted by social norms, perceived behavioural control, awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, an ecological world view and self-transcendence values. Selfenhancement values have a negative impact on personal norms. Based on the model, interventions to change behaviour need not only to include attitude campaigns but also a focus on de-habitualizing behaviour, strengthening the social support and increasing self-efficacy by concrete information about how to act. Value based interventions have only an indirect effect.},

Based on information from a total of 57 samples the present meta-analysis ﬁnds mean correlations between psycho-social variables and pro-environmental behaviour similar to those reported by Hines et al. In a second step, the matrix of pooled correlations is used for a structural equation modelling (SEM) test of theoretically postulated structural relations between eight determinants of pro-environmental behaviour (so-called Meta-analytic SEM (MASEM)). MASEM results conﬁrm that pro-environmental behavioural intention mediate the impact of all other psycho-social variables on pro-environmental behaviour (27\% explained variance). Results also conﬁrm that besides attitude and behavioural control personal moral norm is a third predictor of pro-environmental behavioural intention (52\% explained variance). The MASEM also indicates that problem awareness is an important but indirect determinant of pro-environmental intention. Its impact seems to be mediated by moral and social norms, guilt and attribution processes.},

In previous research the quality of OER has been defined on the basis of quantitative or usage data, but few qualitative insights are available. In this study we analysed how teachers collaboratively assessed ‘big’ OERs, and whether changes occurred in teachers' perceptions of OER by means of collaborative dialogue about the quality of these resources. Five core themes were elicited: (1) content, (2) design, (3) usability, (4) engagement, and (5) readability. Changes we discerned in teachers' perceptions relate to their awareness, attitude and practical issues in relation to OER. Higher education institutes aiming to increase the use of OER should encourage conversation on OER in teacher teams during curriculum reforms, and provide support for the adaptation of resources to teachers' instructional needs and their specific teaching contexts.},

The authors describe the literature on impact assessment in the OER context and the existing contributions to OER impact assessment in higher education. Findings of the analysis are that there are few contributions on the effects of OER in general or of specific OER initiatives. Four contributions are presented in more detail. From these examples and the literature analysis, derivations, and challenges for OER impact assessment are drawn, such as the large diversity in OER purposes and the invisibility of the re-usage of OER. The contribution sketches a framework model for describing OER-relevant results, outcomes, and impact, and more specifically demonstrates how this can be done for exemplary OER-related objectives. This contribution is thus of relevance to funding bodies and institutions working in the context of higher education that wish to systematically evaluate and monitor statements about the effectiveness of OER activities according to the UNESCO (2019) OER recommendation.},

	abstract = {The paper sets out a theoretical approach for understanding the quality of education in low income countries from a social justice perspective. The paper outlines and critiques the two dominant approaches that currently frame the debate about education quality, namely, the human capital and human rights approaches. Drawing principally on the ideas of Nancy Fraser and Amyarta Sen the paper then sets out an alternative approach based on a theory of social justice and of capabilities. The paper develops an overall understanding of how education quality can be understood in relation to the extent to which it fosters key capabilities that individuals, communities and society in general have reason to value. It then analyses three inter-related dimensions of the quality of education from a social justice perspective. Each dimension is considered in relation to contemporary policy debates and research including the work of EdQual. The first dimension, that of inclusion draws attention to the access of different groups of learners to quality inputs that facilitate the development of their capabilities, the cultural and institutional barriers that impact on the learning of different groups and priorities for overcoming these. The second dimension, that of relevance, is concerned with the extent to which the outcomes of education are meaningful for all learners, valued by their communities and consistent with national development priorities in a changing global context, whilst the third dimension, that of democracy considers how decisions about education quality are governed and the nature of participation in debates at the local, national and global levels. It is argued that a social justice framework can provide an alternative rationale for a policy emphasis on quality that encompasses but goes beyond that provided by human capital and rights approaches; that through emphasising the importance of context and through providing a normative basis for thinking about quality in relation to development, it provides a useful starting point for re-conceptualising education quality and how it can be evaluated; and, that it draws attention to the central importance of public dialogue and debate at the local, national and global levels about the nature of a quality education and quality frameworks at these levels.},

	abstract = {Experts discuss the potential for open education tools, resources, and knowledge to transform the economics and ecology of education.Given the abundance of open education initiatives that aim to make educational assets freely available online, the time seems ripe to explore the potential of open education to transform the economics and ecology of education. Despite the diversity of tools and resources already available—from well-packaged course materials to simple games, for students, self-learners, faculty, and educational institutions—we have yet to take full advantage of shared knowledge about how these are being used, what local innovations are emerging, and how to learn from and build on the experiences of others. Opening Up Education argues that we must develop not only the technical capability but also the intellectual capacity for transforming tacit pedagogical knowledge into commonly usable and visible knowledge: by providing incentives for faculty to use (and contribute to) open education goods, and by looking beyond institutional boundaries to connect a variety of settings and open source entrepreneurs. These essays by leaders in open education describe successes, challenges, and opportunies they have found in a range of open education initiatives. They approach—from both macro and micro perspectives—the central question of how open education tools, resources, and knowledge can improve the quality of education. The contributors (from leading foundations, academic institutions, associations, and projects) discuss the strategic underpinnings of their efforts first in terms of technology, then content, and finally knowledge. They also address the impact of their projects, and how close they come to achieving a vision of sustainable, transformative educational opportunities that amounts to much more than pervasive technology.Through the support of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, an electronic version of this book is openly available under a Creative Commons license at The MIT Press Web site, http://mitpress.mit.edu.

	abstract = {"Notions such as wellbeing, freedom, and social justice are integral to evaluating social progress and developing policies. One increasingly influential way to think about these concepts is the capability approach, a theoretical framework which was pioneered by the philosopher and economist Amartya Sen in the 1980s. In this book Ingrid Robeyns orientates readers new to the capability approach through offering an explanation of this framework. Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice also endeavors to resolve historical disputes in the literature and thus will be equally engaging to those familiar with the field. The author offers a novel and illuminating account of how the capability approach can be understood in a variety of academic disciplines and fields of application. Special attention is paid to clarifying misunderstandings that have been caused by different disciplinary assumptions and the interpretive consequences they have for our consideration of the capability approach. 
Robeyns argues that respecting the distinction between the general capability approach, and more specific capability theories or applications, helps to clear up confusion and misinterpretation. In addition, the author presents detailed analyses of well-known objections to the capability approach, and also discusses how it relates to other schools of analysis such as theories of justice, human rights, basic needs, and the human development approach. 
Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice offers an original and comprehensive account of the field. The book will appeal to scholars of the capability approach as well as new readers looking for an interdisciplinary introduction."},

	abstract = {The recent advances in computer-assisted learning systems and the availability of open educational resources today promise a pathway to providing cost-efficient high-quality education to large masses of learners. One of the most ambitious use cases of computer-assisted learning is to build a lifelong learning recommendation system. Unlike short-term courses, lifelong learning presents unique challenges, requiring sophisticated recommendation models that account for a wide range of factors such as background knowledge of learners or novelty of the material while effectively maintaining knowledge states of masses of learners for significantly longer periods of time (ideally, a lifetime). This work presents the foundations towards building a dynamic, scalable and transparent recommendation system for education, modelling learner's knowledge from implicit data in the form of engagement with open educational resources. We i) use a text ontology based on Wikipedia to automatically extract knowledge components of educational resources and, ii) propose a set of online Bayesian strategies inspired by the well-known areas of item response theory and knowledge tracing. Our proposal, TrueLearn, focuses on recommendations for which the learner has enough background knowledge (so they are able to understand and learn from the material), and the material has enough novelty that would help the learner improve their knowledge about the subject and keep them engaged. We further construct a large open educational video lectures dataset and test the performance of the proposed algorithms, which show clear promise towards building an effective educational recommendation system.},

Proper skill mixes for future jobs include strong cognitive skills, basic information and communication technology, and analytical skills, as well as a range of noncognitive skills such as creativity, problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. Retraining and reskilling workers is also crucial. All these changes lead to a major rethinking of education and skill training throughout a person’s life. This paper reviews the recent studies on human capital and skill formation in the era of rapid technological progress. Findings from these studies particularly in labor economics can shed light on new directions for lifelong education policies.},

	abstract = {A landmark in the realization of UNESCO’s Sustainability Goals, Education for All (SDG4), was passed when the organization’s Recommendation of Open Educational Resources (OER) was uniformly adopted in 2019. Now it is time to transfer from the consciousness of OER to their mainstream realization at all levels, micro, meso, and macro, including all stakeholders, such as governments, institutions, academics, teachers, administrators, librarians, students, learners, and the civil service. The OER Recommendation includes five areas: building capacity and utilizing OER; developing supportive policies; ensuring effectiveness; promoting the creation of sustainable OER models; promoting and facilitating international collaboration; monitoring and evaluation. OER are valued as a catalyst for innovation and the achievement of UNESCO’s SDG 4, education for all, lifelong learning, social justice, and human rights. The OER Recommendation will be a catalyst for the realization of several other SDGs. Because access to quality OER concerns human rights and social justice, this Recommendation is vital. In 2020, the effects of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrated the importance of opening up education and the access to internationally recognized, qualified learning resources. This article describes and discusses how the promise of resilient, sustainable quality open education can be fulfilled in the new normal and the next normal.},

Because researchers have mainly focused their work on the study of the relations between social classes and school, they often forgot to question school as a relatively independent sphere of activities where specific practices unfold around specific knowledge.We remind the different historical steps of this “school form of socialization” (forme scolaire de socialisation) in France, from the Ancien Régime colleges on to the relatively unified schools of the 20th century, going through the small schools of Port Royal (1637-1660), the small rural schools of the Ancien Régime, the small urban schools (of Charles Démia and Jean-Baptiste de la Salle), as well as the mutual schools. With this historical reconstruction, the author tends to grasp the school form of socialization with respect to the set of explicit written instructional knowledge matters and to the written objectification of the means required by their learning: i.e. codification of the knowledge to teach and codification of the social learning relationships.},

It begins by reviewing the empirical work that has attempted to estimate the true causal effect of education and training on individual earnings, focusing on the recent literature that has attempted to control for potential biases in the estimated returns to education and training. It then moves on to review the literature that has looked at the returns from human capital investments to employers. Lack of suitable data and methodological difficulties have resulted in a paucity of studies that have carried out sound empirical work on this issue. In the final part of the review, we look at the work that has tried to assess the contribution of human capital to national economic growth at the macroeconomic level. This work has generally involved using either a ‘growth accounting’ theoretical framework or ‘new growth’ theories. Although the empirical macroeconomic evidence that accompanies this work does not generally allow one to distinguish between the two approaches, there is a substantial body of evidence on the contribution of education to economic growth.},

	abstract = {The idea of positive educational externalities is that the benefits of individually acquired education may not be restricted to the individual but might spill over to others as well, accruing at higher aggregation levels, in particular at the macro-economic one. We offer an extensive summary and a critical discussion of the empirical literature on the impact of human capital on macro- economic performance, with a particular focus on UK policy. Key findings include: (1) Taking the studies as a whole, there is compelling evidence that human capital increases productivity. Although there is an important theoretical distinction between the augmented neo-classical approach and the new growth theories, the empirical literature is still largely divided on whether the stock of education affects the long-run level or growth rate of the economy. A one-year increase in average education is found to raise the level of output per capita by between 3 and 6 percent according to augmented neo-classical specifications, while it would lead to an over 1 percentage point faster growth according to estimates from the new-growth theories. (2) Over the short-run planning horizon (4 years) the empirical estimates of the change in GDP for a given increase in the human capital stock are of similar orders of magnitude in the two approaches. (3) The impact of increases at different levels of edu-cation appear to depend on the level of a country's development, with tertiary/higher education being the most important for growth in OECD countries. (4) Education is found to yield additional indirect benefits to growth (in par-ticular, by stimulating physical capital investments and technological development and adoption). More preliminary evidence seems to indicate that type, quality and efficiency of education all matter for growth. The most pressing methodological problems are the measurement of human capital; systematic differences in the coefficient of education across countries (in particular between developing and developed countries) and reverse causality. We also make recommendations for future research priorities.},

	abstract = {Fondé sur l’idée de lutter contre la déforestation par des compensations financières via les marchés carbone, le dispositif Redd+ a généré une nébuleuse d’initiatives de préparation, renouvelant l’agenda international forestier. Ma thèse croise une approche d’études sociales des sciences et l’anthropologie du développement pour interroger les dynamiques qui sous-tendent ce succès diplomatique. Premièrement, une généalogie de la question forestière comme problème global décrit les racines politiques et techniques du paysage institutionnel actuel et du cadrage opéré par le Redd+. Puis une étude multi-sites analyse les enjeux récents du Redd+ à la lumière des réseaux transnationaux d’expertise et des métrologies, dispositifs matériels, standards administratifs, technologies sociales et registres discursifs qui les accompagnent. Les pratiques de quantification du carbone forestier en Guyane sont examinées pour mettre à jour les enchevêtrements matériels, sociaux et politiques complexes entre recherche scientifique et coopération internationale. Le processus complexe de préparation du Cameroun en vue d’un programme de la Banque mondiale montre ensuite le décalage entre la rhétorique d’innovation associée au Redd+ et les facteurs d’enrôlement d’acteurs et d’institutions aux priorités divergentes. Finalement, on analyse l’articulation entre d’une part, l’imbrication des pratiques de savoirs dans les enjeux politiques du développement, et d’autre part, leur rôle paradoxal de dépolitisation de ces enjeux. Plus qu’un outil innovant contre la déforestation et le changement climatique, le Redd+ apparaît comme une promesse dont le succès repose sur sa capacité à renouveler le système d’aide au développement, tout en ancrant l’économie verte comme principal projet politique de réconciliation entre environnement et développement.},

	abstract = {Après la sécheresse qui s'est déclenchée au milieu des années 1960, les précipitations dans les régions du Ouaddaï et du Wadi-Fira, dans l'Est du Tchad, se sont améliorées à partir des années 1990. Dans le même temps, l'impact humain sur les formations végétales s'est amplifié avec l'arrivée massive de réfugiés et de déplacés. Les effets de ces facteurs sont jusqu'à présent peu connus dans cette zone. Le présent article étudie l'évolution des formations forestières et préforestières sur une période de 23 ans (1987-2010). Cette analyse a été réalisée à l'aide des images satellitaires Landsat TM du 04/11/1987, et ETM+ du 22/10/2000 et du 02/10/2010. Cinq classes d'occupation du sol ont été discriminées (Balanites purs, Acacias purs, Mélanges, Sols nus et Roches à nu). Les proportions occupées par les trois premières classes sont respectivement de 0,1 \%, 5,2 \% et 54,3 \% en 1987, de 0,2 \%, 2,4 \% et 48,7 \% en 2000, et de 0,96 \%, 14,3 \% et 61,7 \% en 2010. Entre 1987 et 2000, un fort recul a été enregistré pour les Acacias purs (-53,6 \%) et les Mélanges (-10,4 \%). Mais une progression importante s'est manifestée pour les mêmes classes de 2000 à 2010 : +500 \% pour les Acacias purs et +15,5 \% pour les Mélanges. La classe des Balanites purs n'a jamais atteint 1 \% de la superficie totale. Des observations in situ ont en outre été réalisées à l'automne 2016 sur 240 placettes. La richesse floristique forestière est de 30 espèces. La densité moyenne est de 53 tiges/ha pour les Balanites purs, 35 tiges/ha pour les Acacias purs et 24 tiges/ha pour les Mélanges. L'amélioration des précipitations a favorisé l'installation des espèces de moindre valeur calorifique et fourragères comme Calotropis procera et Leptadenia pyrotechnica. Malgré le retour des précipitations, les ressources ligneuses du Ouaddaï et du Wadi-Fira sont en recul, car soumises à une pression anthropique amplifiée par l'accroissement de population.},

	abstract = {Humanistic approach introduced by the ideas of Scholars like Erickson, Roger, and Maslow began to permeate the field of second language teaching and learning towards the end of 1970. According to Lei (2007) humanistic approach emphasizes the importance of the inner world of the learner and places the individual’s thought, emotions and feelings at the forefront of all human development. Due to this new shift of focus, language education and pedagogy moved away from the previous behavioristic and mentalistic approaches, and as a result, a new kind of education known as humanistic education emerged. Consequently, significant changes occurred in all aspects of language education, that is, the traditional roles of teachers and learners were redefined and the previously authoritarian teaching practices were replaced by learner-centered classrooms. This paper is of two-fold. First, it is going to take a detailed look at the main principles and features of humanistic education, and second, it is aimed at discussing the implications and applications of humanistic education. Finally, it tries to clarify the new roles and responsibilities considered for language teachers to be able to fully engage the students in the learning process.},

Each aspect of the scientific cycle—research design, data collection, analysis, and publication—can and should be made more transparent and accessible. Open Education Science is a set of practices designed to increase the transparency of evidentiary reasoning and access to scientific research in a domain characterized by diverse disciplinary traditions and a commitment to impact in policy and practice.

Open Access in Theory and Practice contributes to a better understanding of 
OA and, as such, should be of great interest to academics, researchers, and students 
working in the fields of information science, publishing studies, science

L’enquête effectuée permet d’en comprendre l’organisation très rationnelle et son évolution spatio-temporelle. L’observation des pratiques spatiales des dragueurs révèle une chorégraphie rituelle, ordonnée par le double langage des corps et des regards et qui donne sa qualité érotique au lieu. Mais surtout, débarrassés des interdits sociaux et moraux et en quête d’un même plaisir furtif, les acteurs qui s’adonnent à d’illicites jeux du sexe et du hasard dans l’espace public en pervertissent l’usage commun et transgressent la norme hétérosexuelle qui l’a façonné.

Despite the important role of human capital in modern societies, there are still many unknowns about the process of educational production as well as individual and collective decisions concerning how much and what kind of education to obtain. This literature review aims at providing a better understanding of the process of human capital formation and educational attainment. Although human capital plays an important role in both microeconomics and macroeconomics, we focus on the former branch of literature in order to analyze the individual incentives to acquire skills. This review is divided into six parts each of them representing an important stream of human capital literature. First, we introduce the basic concept of human capital that models individuals as investing in skills in response to the expected returns to education. After this, we investigate the different implications of investments in general and specific human capital and then provide an overview of various empirical studies measuring the rate of return to education. Because educational attainment may also be affected by other factors such as school characteristics or family background, we review the literature on educational production functions and discuss the significance of potential inputs into the process of educational production. Subsequently, we refer to models of human capital accumulation over the life-cycle that manage to replicate the empirical life-cycle patterns with respect to the age-earnings profile of individuals. Finally, we analyze the effects of taxation and education subsidies on the formation of human capital.},

We develop a quantitative theory of college within the context of general equilibrium overlapping generations economy. College is modeled as a multi-period risky investment with endogenous enrollment, time-to-degree, and dropout behavior. Tuition costs can be financed using federal grants, student loans, and working while at college. We show that our model accounts for the main statistics regarding education (enrollment rate, dropout rate, and time to degree) while matching the observed aggregate wage premiums. Our model predicts that broad based tuition subsidies and grants increase college enrollment. However, due to the correlation between ability and financial resources most of these new students are from the lower end of the ability distribution and eventually dropout or take longer than average to complete college. Merit based education policies counteract this adverse selection problem but at the cost of a muted enrollment response. Our last policy experiment highlights an important interaction between the labor-supply margin and borrowing. A significant decrease in enrollment is found to occur only when borrowing constraints are severely tightened and the option to work while in school is removed. This result suggests that previous models that have ignored the student's labor supply when analyzing borrowing constraints may be insufficient.},

	abstract = {The author, a pioneering researcher on investment in human capital, presents a seminal attempt at a systematic analysis of personal income distribution. The framework is a human capital model based upon the aggregate earnings distribution of white, male, urban workers and the net investments in human capital among these workers. Schooling and post-school investment are designated as the two principal elements of human capital; when specific measures of post-school investment are unavailable, experience (estimated from age and the length of schooling) is used. In the theoretical section, the author demonstrates that years of experience rather than age should be emphasized in interpreting earnings variations. Educational differences of the random group of white, male, urban workers  accounted for only seven percent of the earnings differential. Mincer shows empirically that schooling has more explanatory power for groups with constant years of experience than for groups of the same age, and that the explanatory power is at its peak for groups with seven to nine years of experience. The author finds further confirmation of experience over age in the data on female earnings. Suggestions for future research are the inclusion of females, blacks, older people, and nonurban people and the inclusion of nonemployment income. (Author/EA)},

Of course, every country acknowledges the importance of developing human capital, but Hanushek and Woessmann argue that message has become distorted, with politicians and researchers concentrating not on valued skills but on proxies for them. The common focus is on school attainment, although time in school provides a very misleading picture of how skills enter into development. Hanushek and Woessmann contend that the cognitive skills of the population -- which they term the "knowledge capital" of a nation -- are essential to long-run prosperity. Hanushek and Woessmann subject their hypotheses about the relationship between cognitive skills (as consistently measured by international student assessments) and economic growth to a series of tests, including alternate specifications, different subsets of countries, and econometric analysis of causal interpretations. They find that their main results are remarkably robust, and equally applicable to developing and developed countries. They demonstrate, for example, that the "Latin American growth puzzle" and the "East Asian miracle" can be explained by these regions' knowledge capital. Turning to the policy implications of their argument, they call for an education system that develops effective accountability, promotes choice and competition, and provides direct rewards for good performance.},

	abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:  – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?  – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

	abstract = {Deforestation of the entire Amazon basin — the catastrophe scenario — is projected to result in regional decreases of precipitation and evaporation, potentially leading to sustained desertification. However, current levels and patterns of Amazon deforestation actually enhance mass and energy transfers between the land and the atmosphere through the creation of thermally driven circulations. The climatological effects of these circulations have long been thought to be inconsequential (e.g., Negri et al., 2004). In contrast, we find here that current deforestation causes a dramatic change in climatological rainfall occurrence patterns; high-resolution satellite precipitation measurements show significantly more rainfall occurrences (p ≤ 0.0001) over deforested areas. Moreover, a 75 year-long rain gauge record shows a long-term shift in the seasonality of precipitation that is concurrent with deforestation. These findings suggest that current deforestation in the Amazon has already altered the regional climate. Such changes have implications for regional ecosystem dynamics, but may also affect global climatic patterns through tropospheric teleconnections.},

	abstract = {Earth system models predict a zonal dipole of precipitation change over tropical South America, with decreases over the Amazon and increases over the Andes. Much of this has been attributed to the physiological response of the rainforest to elevated CO2, which describes a basin-wide reduction in stomatal conductance and transpiration. While robust in Earth system model experiments, details of the underlying atmospheric mechanism—specifically how it evolves in the context of land-atmosphere interaction and the diurnal cycle—are unresolved. We investigate this using idealized model simulations and find that within 24 hr of a CO2 increase, changes occur over the Amazon that engender synoptic timescale feedbacks. Decreased evapotranspiration from the rainforest throttles near-surface moisture, inducing a drier, warmer, and deeper boundary layer. Above this, enhanced turbulent diffusivity increases vapor in the lower free troposphere. Together, these processes reduce convective activity and cause immediate decreases in Amazon rainfall. Over the synoptic timescale, these changes leave behind lower tropospheric moisture, which is advected westward by the background jet and increases Andean precipitation. This produces a dipole of precipitation change consistent across global and regional models as well as parameterized and resolved convection, though details are sensitive to model topography and boundary layer formulation. The mechanism reported here stresses the importance of fast timescale processes affecting stability over a period of hours that can influence longer-term vegetation-climate interactions. These results help clarify the Amazon's physiological response to rising CO2 and provide insight into possible causes of historical model biases and end-of-century uncertainty in this region.},

	abstract = {The Amazon forest enhances precipitation levels regionally as trees take up water from the soil and release it back into the atmosphere through transpiration. Therefore, land-use changes in the Amazon affect precipitation patterns but to what extent remains unclear. Recent studies used hydrological and atmospheric models to estimate the contribution of tree transpiration to precipitation but assumed that precipitation decreases proportionally to the transpired portion of atmospheric moisture. Here, we relaxed this assumption by, first, relating observed hourly precipitation levels to atmospheric column water vapor in a relatively flat study area encompassing a large part of the Amazon. We found that the effect of column water vapor on hourly precipitation was strongly nonlinear, showing a steep increase in precipitation above a column water vapor content of around 60 mm. Next, we used published atmospheric trajectories of moisture from tree transpiration across the whole Amazon to estimate the transpiration component in column water vapor in our study area. Finally, we estimated precipitation reductions for column water vapor levels without this transpired moisture, given the nonlinear relationship we found. Although loss of tree transpiration from the Amazon causes a 13\% drop in column water vapor, we found that it could result in a 55\%–70\% decrease in precipitation annually. Consequences of this nonlinearity might be twofold: although the effects of deforestation may be underestimated, it also implies that forest restoration may be more effective for precipitation enhancement than previously assumed.},

	abstract = {Observations show that the standard precipitation index (SPI) over the southern Amazon region decreased in the period of 1970–1999 by 0.32 per decade, indicating an increase in dry conditions. Simulations of constant pre-industrial climate with recent climate models indicate a low probability (p=0\%) that the trends are due to internal climate variability. When the 23 models are forced with either anthropogenic factors or both anthropogenic and external natural factors, approximately 13\% of sampled 30-year SPI trends from the models are found to be within the range of the observed SPI trend at 95\% confidence level. This suggests a possibility of anthropogenic and external forcing of climate change in the southern Amazon. On average, the models project no changes in the frequency of occurrence of low SPI values in the future; however, those models which produce more realistic SPI climatology, variability and trend over the period 1970–1999 show more of a tendency towards more negative values of SPI in the future. The analysis presented here suggests a potential anthropogenic influence on Amazon drying, which warrants future, more in-depth, study.},

	abstract = {We analyze the local and remote impacts of climate change on the hydroclimate of the Amazon and La Plata basins of South America (SA) in an ensemble of four 21st century projections (1970–2100, RCP8.5 scenario) with the regional climate model RegCM4 driven by the HadGEM, GFDL and MPI global climate models (GCMs) over the SA CORDEX domain. Two RegCM4 configurations are used, one employing the CLM land surface and the Emanuel convective schemes, and one using the BATS land surface and Grell (over land) convection schemes. First, we find considerable sensitivity of the precipitation change signal to both the driving GCM and the RegCM4 physics schemes (with the latter even greater than the first), highlighting the pronounced uncertainty of regional projections over the region. However, some improvements in the simulation of the annual cycle of precipitation over the Amazon and La Plata basins is found when using RegCM4, and some consistent change signals across the experiments are found. One is a tendency towards an extension of the dry season over central SA deriving from a late onset and an early retreat of the SA monsoon. The second is a dipolar response consisting of reduced precipitation over the broad Amazon and Central Brazil region and increased precipitation over the La Plata basin and central Argentina. An analysis of the relative influence on the change signal of local soil-moisture feedbacks and remote effects of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over the Niño 3.4 region indicates that the former is prevalent over the Amazon basin while the latter dominates over the La Plata Basin. Also, the soil moisture feedback has a larger role in RegCM4 than in the GCMs.},

First, it is living through a diversification of the goals it is asked to pursue: to its traditional objective of ushering convergence between less and more developed economies have progressively been adjoined those of financing access to essential services and protecting global public goods. Secondly, faced with this new array of challenges, the world of development aid has demonstrated an impressive capacity to increase the number and diversity of its players, generating a governance conundrum for this eminently fragmented global policy. Thirdly, the instruments used by this expanding array of actors to achieve a broader range of policy objectives have themselves mushroomed, in the wake of innovations in mainstream financial markets. Yet surprisingly, this triple revolution in goals, actors and tools has not yet impacted the way we measure both the financial volumes dedicated to this emerging global policy nor the concrete impacts it aims to achieve. This paper argues for the need to move from the conventional measure of Official Development Assistance to the construction of clearer benchmarks for what ultimately matters: resources and results that concur to 21st century international development.},

The introduction and spread of digital maps and mapping software, however, have added new wrinkles to the ever-evolving landscape of modern mapmaking. ​Fully updated for the digital age, this new edition of How to Lie with Maps examines the myriad ways that technology offers new opportunities for cartographic mischief, deception, and propaganda. While retaining the same brevity, range, and humor as its predecessors, this third edition includes significant updates throughout as well as new chapters on image maps, prohibitive cartography, and online maps. It also includes an expanded section of color images and an updated list of sources for further reading.},

We clarify their role by arguing that they are contingent enabling factors, not stable difference-makers, in the production of EDD. We maintain that two stable difference-makers are core to the production of EDD: production of skewed science and effective public dissemination.},

Their journey would prove an extraordinary collaboration and a watershed literary event when, in 1941, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men was first published to enormous critical acclaim. This unsparing record of place, of the people who shaped the land and the rhythm of their lives, is intensely moving and unrelentingly honest, and today—recognized by the New York Public Library as one of the most influential books of the twentieth century—it stands as a poetic tract of its time. With an elegant new design as well as a sixty-four-page photographic prologue featuring archival reproductions of Evans's classic images, this historic edition offers readers a window into a remarkable slice of American history.},

This can be overcome by devising a place where it is possible to relate the intrinsic and instrumental values of Nature; (ii) Second, the issue of responsibility, which is only considered from a consequentialist viewpoint by Sen (i.e. ex-post responsibility). Such a restrictive view can be extended by adding the exante dimension of responsibility; (iii) Third, the relationship between the individual and collective levels. This can be overcome by introducing the idea of collective agency. Overcoming these limitations makes it possible to fully integrate the ecological dimension into an extended vision of the capability approach which makes it consistent with strong sustainability, and which leads to a new deﬁnition of the agent as a responsible person acting so as to generate sustainable human development.},

	abstract = {In statistics, one-way analysis of variance (abbreviated one-way ANOVA) is a technique that can be used to compare whether two sample's means are significantly different or not (using the F distribution). This technique can be used only for numerical response data, the "Y", usually one variable, and numerical or (usually) categorical input data, the "X", always one variable, hence "one-way".The ANOVA tests the null hypothesis, which states that samples in all groups are drawn from populations with the same mean values.  To do this, two estimates are made of the population variance.  These estimates rely on various assumptions (see below). The ANOVA produces an F-statistic, the ratio of the variance calculated among the means to the variance within the samples. If the group means are drawn from populations with the same mean values, the variance between the group means should be lower than the variance of the samples, following the central limit theorem. A higher ratio therefore implies that the samples were drawn from populations with different mean values.Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a t-test (Gosset, 1908). When there are only two means to compare, the t-test and the F-test are equivalent; the relation between ANOVA and t is given by F = t2. An extension of one-way ANOVA is two-way analysis of variance that examines the influence of two different categorical independent variables on one dependent variable.},

	abstract = {Background
Public trust in immunization is an increasingly important global health issue. Losses in confidence in vaccines and immunization programmes can lead to vaccine reluctance and refusal, risking disease outbreaks and challenging immunization goals in high- and low-income settings. National and international immunization stakeholders have called for better monitoring of vaccine confidence to identify emerging concerns before they evolve into vaccine confidence crises.
Methods
We perform a large-scale, data-driven study on worldwide attitudes to immunizations. This survey – which we believe represents the largest survey on confidence in immunization to date – examines perceptions of vaccine importance, safety, effectiveness, and religious compatibility among 65,819 individuals across 67 countries. Hierarchical models are employed to probe relationships between individual- and country-level socio-economic factors and vaccine attitudes obtained through the four-question, Likert-scale survey.
Findings
Overall sentiment towards vaccinations is positive across all 67 countries, however there is wide variability between countries and across world regions. Vaccine-safety related sentiment is particularly negative in the European region, which has seven of the ten least confident countries, with 41\% of respondents in France and 36\% of respondents in Bosnia \& Herzegovina reporting that they disagree that vaccines are safe (compared to a global average of 13\%). The oldest age group (65+) and Roman Catholics (amongst all faiths surveyed) are associated with positive views on vaccine sentiment, while the Western Pacific region reported the highest level of religious incompatibility with vaccines. Countries with high levels of schooling and good access to health services are associated with lower rates of positive sentiment, pointing to an emerging inverse relationship between vaccine sentiments and socio-economic status.
Conclusions
Regular monitoring of vaccine attitudes – coupled with monitoring of local immunization rates – at the national and sub-national levels can identify populations with declining confidence and acceptance. These populations should be prioritized to further investigate the drivers of negative sentiment and to inform appropriate interventions to prevent adverse public health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background
There is growing evidence of vaccine delays or refusals due to a lack of trust in the importance, safety, or effectiveness of vaccines, alongside persisting access issues. Although immunisation coverage is reported administratively across the world, no similarly robust monitoring system exists for vaccine confidence. In this study, vaccine confidence was mapped across 149 countries between 2015 and 2019.
Methods
In this large-scale retrospective data-driven analysis, we examined global trends in vaccine confidence using data from 290 surveys done between September, 2015, and December, 2019, across 149 countries, and including 284 381 individuals. We used a Bayesian multinomial logit Gaussian process model to produce estimates of public perceptions towards the safety, importance, and effectiveness of vaccines. Associations between vaccine uptake and a large range of putative drivers of uptake, including vaccine confidence, socioeconomic status, and sources of trust, were determined using univariate Bayesian logistic regressions. Gibbs sampling was used for Bayesian model inference, with 95\% Bayesian highest posterior density intervals used to capture uncertainty.
Findings
Between November, 2015, and December, 2019, we estimate that confidence in the importance, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines fell in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Korea. We found significant increases in respondents strongly disagreeing that vaccines are safe between 2015 and 2019 in six countries: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Serbia. We find signs that confidence has improved between 2018 and 2019 in some EU member states, including Finland, France, Ireland, and Italy, with recent losses detected in Poland. Confidence in the importance of vaccines (rather than in their safety or effectiveness) had the strongest univariate association with vaccine uptake compared with other determinants considered. When a link was found between individuals' religious beliefs and uptake, findings indicated that minority religious groups tended to have lower probabilities of uptake.
Interpretation
To our knowledge, this is the largest study of global vaccine confidence to date, allowing for cross-country comparisons and changes over time. Our findings highlight the importance of regular monitoring to detect emerging trends to prompt interventions to build and sustain vaccine confidence.

In this review, we discuss the major and diverse roles GABAA receptors play in the regulation of neuronal communication and the functioning of the brain. GABAA receptors have complex electrophysiological properties that enable them to mediate different types of currents such as phasic and tonic inhibitory currents. Their activity is finely regulated by membrane voltage, phosphorylation and several ions. GABAA receptors are pentameric and are assembled from a diverse set of subunits. They are subdivided into numerous subtypes, which differ widely in expression patterns, distribution and electrical activity. Substantial variations in macroscopic neural behavior can emerge from minor differences in structure and molecular activity between subtypes. Therefore, the diversity of GABAA receptors widens the neuronal repertoire of responses to external signals and contributes to shaping the electrical activity of neurons and other cell types.},

	abstract = {Background
We investigated a consecutive series of children with chronic enterocolitis and regressive developmental disorder.
Methods
12 children (mean age 6 years [range 3–10], 11 boys) were referred to a paediatric gastroenterology unit with a history of normal development followed by loss of acquired skills, including language, together with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Children underwent gastroenterological, neurological, and developmental assessment and review of developmental records. Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy sampling, magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and lumbar puncture were done under sedation. Barium follow-through radiography was done where possible. Biochemical, haematological, and immunological profiles were examined.
Findings
Onset of behavioural symptoms was associated, by the parents, with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children, with measles infection in one child, and otitis media in another. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities, ranging from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration. Histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon in 11 children and reactive ileal lymphoid hyperplasia in seven, but no granulomas. Behavioural disorders included autism (nine), disintegrative psychosis (one), and possible postviral or vaccinal encephalitis (two). There were no focal neurological abnormalities and MRI and EEG tests were normal. Abnormal laboratory results were significantly raised urinary methylmalonic acid compared with agematched controls (p=0·003), low haemoglobin in four children, and a low serum IgA in four children.
Interpretation
We identified associated gastrointestinal disease and developmental regression in a group of previously normal children, which was generally associated in time with possible environmental triggers.},

Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner pursued evidence steadily and relentlessly, interviewed the important players, investigated untapped sources, and uncovered a bruising story of cynical and cruel disregard for health and human rights. This resulting exposé is full of startling revelations, provocative arguments, and disturbing conclusions--all based on remarkable research and information gleaned from secret industry documents. This book reveals for the first time the public relations campaign that the lead industry undertook to convince Americans to use its deadly product to paint walls, toys, furniture, and other objects in America's homes, despite a wealth of information that children were at risk for serious brain damage and death from ingesting this poison. This book highlights the immediate dangers ordinary citizens face because of the relentless failure of industrial polluters to warn, inform, and protect their workers and neighbors. It offers a historical analysis of how corporate control over scientific research has undermined the process of proving the links between toxic chemicals and disease. The authors also describe the wisdom, courage, and determination of workers and community members who continue to voice their concerns in spite of vicious opposition. Readable, ground-breaking, and revelatory, Deceit and Denial provides crucial answers to questions of dangerous environmental degradation, escalating corporate greed, and governmental disregard for its citizens' safety and health. After eleven years, Markowitz and Rosner update their work with a new epilogue that outlines the attempts these industries have made to undermine and create doubt about the accuracy of the information in this book.},

By “dissent,” we refer to the act of objecting to a particular conclusion, especially one that is widely held. While dissent in science can clearly be beneficial, there might be some instances of dissent that not only fail to contribute to scientific progress, but actually impede it. Potential examples of this include the tobacco industry’s funding of studies that questioned the link between smoking and lung cancer, and the attempt by the petroleum industry and other groups to cast doubt upon the conclusion that human consumption of fossil fuels contributes to global climate change. The problem of distinguishing between good and bad dissent is important because of the growing tendency of some stakeholders to attempt to delay political action by ’manufacturing doubt’ (Oreskes \& Conway 2010). Our discussion in this paper focuses on climate science. This field, in our view, is rife with instances of bad dissent. On the basis of our discussion of climate science, we articulate a set of sufficient conditions for epistemically problematic dissent in general, which we call “the inductive risk account of epistemically detrimental dissent.”},

            Criticism plays an essential role in the growth of scientific knowledge. In some cases, however, criticism can have detrimental effects; for example, it can be used to "manufacture doubt" for the purpose of impeding public policy making on issues such as tobacco consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we build on previous work by Biddle and Leuschner who argue that criticism that meets certain conditions can be epistemically detrimental. We extend and refine their account by arguing that such criticism can be epistemically corrupting—it can create conditions that are conducive to the development of epistemic vice by agents operating within them.},

He says that I corrupt them by teaching belief in new gods, and unbelief in the true and ancient gods.

He knows that such calumnies find ready admission with most minds. So also, people laugh at me, when I talk about religion, and when I predict future events in the assembly.

It appears that this word aggregated successively different and sometimes conflicting meanings throughout its history. One of the main present occidental meanings of “nature”, designating what is opposed to humans, currently used in public policies, conservation science, or environmental ethics, hence appears rare and recent, and contradictory with most other visions of nature, including former European representations and contemporary foreign ones. Nature preservation ought to take into account this semantic diversity when proposing policies, integrating the relativity and potential inaccuracy of the currently dominating occidental definition.},

Responding to this need in the United States, nine federal agencies have signed a memorandum of understanding on the subject of developing a common framework of ecoregions. However, considerable disagreement over how to define ecoregions and confusion over the strengths and limitations of existing frameworks stand in the way of achieving this goal. This paper presents some perspectives on the nature and definition of ecoregions related to this confusion and provides a brief overview of the weight of evidence approach to mapping ecoregions, using an example initiated by the US Environmental Protection Agency. To effectively implement ecosystem assessment, management, and research at local, regional, and national levels, research is needed to increase our understanding of ecoregions. We must find ways to illustrate the nature of ecoregion boundaries and the variability of characteristics within ecoregions as they relate to management issues. Research must also be conducted on comparing existing frameworks and developing indices of ecological integrity to effectively evaluate their usefulness.},

A climate club is particularly likely to persist and grow if initiated by the United States and the European Union.

	abstract = {The Global Pact for the Environment is a project for an international treaty that seeks to recognize the environmental rights and duties of citizens, states, and businesses. The text of the initial Pact project was drafted in June 2017 by a network of over 100 environmental law experts from more than 40 countries. In May 2018, the United Nations General Assembly paved the way for its negotiation by adopting the resolution “Towards a Global Pact for the Environment”. These talks resulted in a recommendation for states to adopt a “political declaration” in 2022 for the 50th anniversary of the Stockholm Conference. This article retraces the origins of the Global Pact project and makes the case for its adoption. It argues that a Global Pact is the missing piece to implement the 2030 Agenda and would help to “constitutionalize” fundamental environmental principles. The article further responds to concerns raised about the Global Pact project, such as interactions with existing instruments, the applicability of broad principles at the national level, as well as the risk of regression. It ultimately asserts that all stakeholders would reap beneﬁts from its procedural and substantive provisions, should it be adopted.},

	abstract = {After the failure of Copenhagen in 2009, doctrine has talked about a multilateralism in crisis. This multilateralism characterized by state equality, reciprocity and continuity has appeared utterly incapable of bringing good cooperation between States so as to reach the adoption of a binding agreement to organize the fight against climate warming. This multilateralism is usually opposed to alliances occasionally formed and characterised by a geopolitical logic of power, of selectivity. The Copenhagen failure has brought forward this tough geopolitical logic (hard gaps were created between developed and developing States, emerging economies) revealing a very weak climate governance that was striving to cope with an already very complex and multiscale issue. As numerous political scientists have proposed other suggestions, many States have preferred the very limited structure of clubs. The COP 21 and the Paris agreement have put back on track the UN process that was gridlocked even if the oppositions of viewpoints have not vanished and the coalitions of interests are remaining. The solution of multilateralism that enables a balance and flexible solution between unilateralism and the partly binding character of the agreement explains this success as well as the increase involvement of civil society.},

	abstract = {Le 10 mai 2018, l'Assemblée générale des Nations Unies (l'Assemblée) a adopté la résolution 72/277 intitulée "Vers un pacte mondial pour l'environnement".

L'initiative pour un pacte mondial pour l'environnement vise à fournir un cadre global au droit international de l'environnement visant à consolider, renforcer et faire progresser le droit international de l'environnement en tenant compte des défis environnementaux urgents. L'initiative vise également à améliorer la mise en œuvre du droit international de l'environnement en faveur des objectifs de développement durable, ainsi que des objectifs et cibles environnementaux convenus à l'échelle mondiale.

Selon le texte de la résolution, l’Assemblée a décidé de créer un groupe de travail spécial à composition non limitée chargé d’examiner un rapport technique et factuel qui recense et évalue les lacunes éventuelles du droit international de l’environnement et des instruments environnementaux en vue de renforcer leur mise en œuvre. Le rapport doit être soumis à la soixante-treizième session de l'Assemblée en 2018, fournissant une plateforme pour discuter des options possibles pour remédier à ces lacunes. Cela peut inclure la nécessité de convoquer une conférence intergouvernementale pour adopter un tel instrument international. Le groupe de travail a été chargé de présenter ses recommandations à l'Assemblée générale au cours du premier semestre de 2019.

L’Assemblée a décidé que le groupe de travail spécial à composition non limitée tiendra les sessions suivantes, conformément à la pratique établie :

a) Une session d’organisation, qui se tiendra pendant trois jours ouvrables, à la fin de la soixante-douzième session de l’Assemblée générale, à New York, pour examiner les questions relatives à l’organisation des travaux du Groupe spécial. groupe de travail à composition non limitée, y compris la durée et le nombre de ses sessions de fond; et

b) Séances de fond qui se tiendront à Nairobi, dont la première au moins un mois après la présentation du rapport du Secrétaire général.

Les organisations non gouvernementales dotées du statut consultatif auprès du Conseil économique et social, ainsi que celles accréditées pour les conférences et sommets pertinents, peuvent assister aux sessions du groupe de travail spécial à composition non limitée en qualité d’observateurs. La première session de fond du groupe de travail se réunira à Nairobi du 14 au 18 janvier 2019.

Le programme complet sera disponible ultérieurement. Veuillez consulter les informations fournies sur le site internet du Pacte mondial pour l'environnement.},

	abstract = {Background: YouTube™ and Dropbox© studies have warned against the deadly potential of push-scooters. Aims: Through three studies, we evaluate the potential of a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for preventing push-scooter accidents. Study Design: Studies 1 and 2 are retrospective observational studies in which we rely on archival data to explore the relationship between push-scooters accidents (PSA) and usage of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (HCQ + AZT) in France in 2020 and 2019 respectively (7 participants). Study 3 is a partly randomized clinical trial (pRCT), retrospective, in which the use of HCQ + AZT for preventing PSA was assessed in a radically “direct” way (6 participants). Place and Duration of Study: Studies 1 and 2 were conducted in the authors’ office chair (Ikea) in France (multicentric), on July 20th, 2020. Study 3 was conducted in the parking lot of an abandoned factory (Montcuq, Occitan region, France).
Methodology: For Studies 1 and 2, we used data from OpenMEDIC to determine usage of hydroxychloroquine in France in 2020 and Google Actuality to determine the rate of PSA in France in 2020. For Study 3, we adopted an experimental approach and had participants exposed to HCQ + AZ (treatment group) or homeopathy (control group) before having them perform a standard push-scooter exercise. Advanced statistical models were used to assess the prophylactic effect of the HCQ + AZT combination on PSA.
Results: Wide use of hydroxychloroquine is strongly associated with a very low level of PSA, both in time (2020 VS 2019) and in space (Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhônes versus the rest of France). Moreover, the results of our retrospective pRCT prove without any doubt that prophylactic use of a HCQ + AZT combination helped to prevent PSA.
Conclusion: The HCQ + AZT combo should urgently be used in prevention of PSA all around the world.},

	abstract = {Congratulations to Elinor Ostrom, Co-Winner of The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2009! The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

Il est l'une des figures de proue de la lutte pour l'indépendance de l'Inde et du Congrès national indien et devient le premier Premier ministre de l'Inde du 15 août 1947 jusqu'à sa mort.
Pendant les dix-sept années de son mandat, le Congrès remporte largement trois victoires électorales successives. Nehru préside à l'adoption de la Constitution de l'Inde, lance de vastes réformes industrielles et agraires d'inspiration socialiste et participe à la fondation du Mouvement des non-alignés. Il est crédité pour être à l'origine de la fondation de l'État indien moderne et laïc.
Fils du leader indépendantiste Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru est le frère de Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit et de Krishna Hutheesing, le père d'Indira Gandhi (Première ministre de 1966 à 1977 et de 1980 à 1984), le grand-père de Rajiv Gandhi (Premier ministre de 1984 à 1989) et l'arrière-grand-père de Rahul Gandhi (président du Congrès de 2017 à 2019).},

This paper seeks to test whether this belief is well-founded. An application of the Diffusion Index to time-series data collected from a rapidly growing, low income country demonstrates that while higher national income makes for greater welfare the rate of welfare enhancement is almost independent of the rate of national income growth. On the basis of these findings, it is argued that the Gross National Product by itself may not be used as a reliable measure of human welfare. Finally, this paper suggests that in order to provide the maximum quality of life for the members of a given society, its national policy should be based on a much broader conception of welfare than is currently implied by the idea of GNP growthmanship.},

During its investigation of the anthrax mailings, the FBI worked with other federal agencies to coordinate and conduct scientific analyses of the anthrax letter spore powders, environmental samples, clinical samples, and samples collected from laboratories that might have been the source of the letter-associated spores. The agency relied on external experts, including some who had developed tests to differentiate among strains of B. anthracis. In 2008, seven years into the investigation, the FBI asked the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct an independent review of the scientific approaches used during the investigation of the 2001 B. anthracis mailings.

	abstract = {Study region
Upper Madeira Basin (975,500 km2) in Southern Amazonia, which is suffering a biophysical transition, involving deforestation and changes in rainfall regime.
Study focus
The evolution of the runoff coefficient (Rc: runoff/rainfall) is examined as an indicator of the environmental changes (1982–2017).
New hydrological insights for the region
At an annual scale, the Rc at Porto Velho station declines while neither the basin-averaged rainfall nor the runoff change. During the low-water period Rc and runoff diminish while no changes are observed in rainfall. This cannot be explained by increase of evapotranspiration since the basin-averaged actual evapotranspiration decreases. To explain the decrease of Rc, a regional analysis is undertaken. While the characteristic rainfall-runoff time-lag (CT) at Porto Velho basin is estimated to 60 days, CT is higher (65–75 days) in the south and lower (50 days) over the Amazon-Andes transition regions. It is found that 1) the southern basin (south of 14 °S) best explains low-level Porto Velho runoff, 2) in the south, rainfall diminishes and the frequency of dry days increases. Both features explain the diminution of the runoff and the Rc in Porto Velho. Moreover, the increasing dryness in the south compensates for the rainfall and frequency of wet days ({\textgreater}10 mm) increase north of 14 °S and explains the lack of basin-averaged rainfall trends of the upper Madeira basin.},

	abstract = {To analyze the global hydroclimate response during the Younger Dryas cold event, we evaluate climate model results that have been constrained with proxy-based temperatures from the North Atlantic region. We ﬁnd that both the temperature and the hydroclimate response have a clear global signature. A marked cooling is simulated over the North Atlantic Ocean (more than 5  C) and the downwind continents (2e4  C). This response is related to the weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation under inﬂuence of meltwater discharges. The hydroclimate response is most expressed over Eurasia in a belt between 40 and 60 N, and over Northern Africa in the Sahel region. In both areas, a strong decrease in soil moisture is simulated (up to 20\% reduction). In contrast, a striking increase in moisture is found over southeastern North America (15\% increase), where southerly atmospheric ﬂow brings moist air to the continent. Outside these areas that are clearly affected by the cold North Atlantic Ocean, the responses of temperature and moisture are decoupled, with different causes for these temperature and hydroclimate responses. In the tropics, the hydroclimate response is governed by the southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) due to the cooling of the North Atlantic Ocean. This causes drier conditions north of the equator and wetter conditions in the Southern Hemisphere tropics. The associated changes in soil moisture are relatively gradual here, taking up to two centuries to complete, suggesting that the impact of the ITCZ shift on the tropical hydroclimate is building up. Our experiment indicates that Southern Hemisphere continents experienced a small cooling (less than 0.5  C) during the Younger Dryas, caused by the negative radiative forcing associated with reduced atmospheric methane concentrations and enhanced dust levels. In our simulation, the bi-polar seesaw mechanism is relatively weak, so that the associated warming of the South Atlantic Ocean is not overwhelming the reduction in radiative forcing. Our results thus indicate that in the tropics and/or Southern Hemisphere, the cooling is a response to the negative radiative forcing, while the hydroclimatic changes are predominantly resulting from ITCZ variations. Consequently, when interpreting hydroclimatic proxy records from these regions, data should not be compared directly to key records from high latitudes, such as Greenland ice core stable isotope records.},

	abstract = {The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is part of a global thermohaline circulation in the oceans and is the zonally integrated component of surface and deep currents in the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by a northward flow of warm, salty water in the upper layers of the Atlantic, and a southward flow of colder, deep waters. These "limbs" are linked by regions of overturning in the Nordic and Labrador Seas and the Southern Ocean, although the extent of overturning in the Labrador Sea is disputed. The AMOC is an important component of the Earth's climate system, and is a result of both atmospheric and thermohaline drivers.
Climate change has the potential to weaken the AMOC through increases in ocean heat content and elevated freshwater flows from the melting ice sheets. Oceanographic reconstructions generally suggest that the AMOC is already weaker than it was before the Industrial Revolution, although there is a robust debate over the role of climate change versus the circulation's century-scale and millennial-scale variability. Climate models consistently project that the AMOC would weaken further over the 21st century,: 19  which would affect average temperature over areas like Scandinavia and Britain that are warmed by the North Atlantic drift, as well as accelerate sea level rise around North America and reduce primary production in the North Atlantic.Severe weakening of the AMOC has the potential to cause an outright collapse of the circulation, which would not be easily reversible and thus constitute one of the tipping points in the climate system. A shutdown would have far greater impacts than a slowdown on both the marine and some terrestrial ecosystems: it would lower the average temperature and precipitation in Europe, slashing the region's agricultural output, and may have a substantial effect on extreme weather events. Earth system models used in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project indicate that shutdown is only likely after high levels of warming are sustained well after 2100, but they have been criticized by some researchers for what they saw as excessive stability, and a number of lower-complexity studies argue that a collapse can happen considerably earlier. On the other hand, paleoceanographic research suggests that the AMOC may be even more stable than what is assumed by most models.},

The shale boom in the US was a game changer, as was the election of Donald Trump as US president. Trump pushed an ambitious “America first” agenda aimed at transforming the US into a global energy superpower. The purpose of this article is two-fold: first, it outlines the key pillars of the emerging global energy order. Second, it underscores the role of contingent events, a factor neglected by some previous studies because of their reliance on what A.O.Hirschman (1970) termed “paradigmatic thinking”. The recent transition in the international energy order is an outcome of two paramount, yet largely unanticipated events: the shale revolution in the US and Trump’s neomercantilist and unilateralist economic policies. While contingencies are an inherent feature of social reality, the scenario approach can be a useful heuristic for dealing with uncertainties. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these developments for global energy governance.},

However, the long-term goals and international cooperation on climate change will be affected by budget cuts in American climate change research and the cancelation of donations from the multilateral environmental fund of the U.S. If the Paris Agreement is renegotiated, the common but differentiated principle of responsibility of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be challenged again.

En novembre 2021, 193 membres de la convention-cadre des Nations unies sur les changements climatiques (CCNUCC) sont parties à l'accord. Parmi les quatre États membres de la CCNUCC qui n'ont pas ratifié l'accord, le seul grand émetteur est l'Iran, bien que le président iranien ait approuvé l'adhésion. Les États-Unis se sont retirés de l'accord en 2020, mais l'ont réintégré en 2021.
L'objectif à long terme de l'accord de Paris en matière de température est de maintenir l'augmentation de la température moyenne de la planète bien en dessous de 2 °C par rapport aux niveaux préindustriels, et de préférence de limiter l'augmentation à 1,5 °C, en reconnaissant que cela réduirait considérablement les impacts du changement climatique. Les émissions devraient être réduites dès que possible et atteindre le niveau net zéro dans la seconde moitié du XXIe siècle. Il vise à accroître la capacité des parties à s'adapter aux impacts du changement climatique et à mobiliser des financements suffisants. En vertu de l'accord, chaque pays doit déterminer et planifier ses contributions, et en rendre compte régulièrement. Aucun mécanisme n'oblige un pays à fixer des objectifs d'émissions spécifiques, mais chaque nouvel objectif doit aller au-delà des précédents. Contrairement au protocole de Kyoto de 1997, l'accord ne distingue pas entre pays développés et pays en développement, de sorte que ces derniers doivent également soumettre des plans de réduction des émissions.
L'accord a été salué par les dirigeants mondiaux, mais critiqué comme insuffisamment contraignant par certains analystes et environnementalistes. L'efficacité de l'accord fait débat. Les engagements actuels dans le cadre de l'accord de Paris sont insuffisants pour atteindre les objectifs de température fixés, même si les mécanismes de contributions déterminées au niveau national (CDN) et de bilan mondial permettent d'accroître les ambitions des pays. L'accord de Paris a aussi été utilisé avec succès dans le cadre de litiges sur le climat, obligeant des pays et une compagnie pétrolière à renforcer leur action en faveur du climat.},

	abstract = {For decades, combating climate change has been a global challenge, which requires jointly coordinated efforts by numerous, international actors. However, it has been shown time and again that agreeing on globally binding agreements without a global government proves difficult. To this end, this paper examines the possibility of a tolerance premium. This means a transfer payment in exchange for accepting and complying with the associated agreement. The provider of this tolerance premium determines the conditions of its payment to set desired incentives. Thus, collective decision making can also be self-enforced without a higher authority. This scenario is studied analytically based on Dixit’s conflict model. The study shows that the optimal tolerance premium depends only on the value of the prize to the transferee and that this can result in a stalling of the conflict. The implications of this model shed light on the design of global climate agreements that are self-enforcing without the need for a global government. For this purpose, the upfront payment of funds and their reimbursement as a tolerance premium serve as an incentive to comply with collectively agreed rules in climate policy.},

Currently, non-mobile tet(X) and mobile plasmid-mediated transmissible tet(X) and resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump tmexCD-toprJ genes, conferring high-level TIG (HLT) resistance have been detected in humans, animals, and environmental ecosystems. Given the increasing rate of development and spread of plasmid-mediated resistance against the two last-resort antibiotics, colistin (COL) and TIG, there is a need to alert the global community on the emergence and spread of plasmid-mediated HLT resistance and the need for nations, especially developing countries, to increase their antimicrobial stewardship. Justifiably, MTR spread projects One Health ramifications and portends a monumental threat to global public and animal health, which could lead to outrageous health and economic impact due to limited options for therapy. To delve more into this very important subject matter, this current work will discuss why MTR is an emerging health catastrophe requiring urgent One Health global intervention, which has been constructed as follows: (a) antimicrobial activity of TIG; (b) mechanism of TIG resistance; (c) distribution, reservoirs, and traits of MTR gene-harboring isolates; (d) causes of MTR development; (e) possible MTR gene transfer mode and One Health implication; and (f) MTR spread and mitigating strategies.},

Each type of Roscas allows individuals without access to credit markets to improve their welfare, but under a reasonable assumption on preferences, random allocation is preferred when individuals have identical tastes. This conclusion need not hold when individuals are heterogeneous. We also discuss the sustainability of Roscas given the possibility of default.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a global health challenge, involving the transfer of bacteria and genes between humans, animals and the environment. Although multiple barriers restrict the flow of both bacteria and genes, pathogens recurrently acquire new resistance factors from other species, thereby reducing our ability to prevent and treat bacterial infections. Evolutionary events that lead to the emergence of new resistance factors in pathogens are rare and challenging to predict, but may be associated with vast ramifications. Transmission events of already widespread resistant strains are, on the other hand, common, quantifiable and more predictable, but the consequences of each event are limited. Quantifying the pathways and identifying the drivers of and bottlenecks for environmental evolution and transmission of antibiotic resistance are key components to understand and manage the resistance crisis as a whole. In this Review, we present our current understanding of the roles of the environment, including antibiotic pollution, in resistance evolution, in transmission and as a mere reflection of the regional antibiotic resistance situation in the clinic. We provide a perspective on current evidence, describe risk scenarios, discuss methods for surveillance and the assessment of potential drivers, and finally identify some actions to mitigate risks.},

This work conducts a comparative analysis of the six different collaborative platforms for the production of books. To be able to compare the platforms, several dimensions extracted from literature of collaborative writing and the requirements associated with open textbooks are described and used. As conclusion of the study, it is clear that Connexions is currently the best option for the collaborative production of open textbooks although it lacks some basic functionality. This work recommend the creation of a new breed of platforms that better support the producers of open textbooks that inherit all the successful capabilities of the current generation.},

	abstract = {The bandwagon effect is the tendency for people to adopt certain behaviors, styles, or attitudes simply because others are doing so. More specifically, it is a cognitive bias by which public opinion or behaviours can alter due to particular actions and beliefs rallying amongst the public. It is a psychological phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases with respect to the proportion of others who have already done so. As more people come to believe in something, others also "hop on the bandwagon" regardless of the underlying evidence.
Following others' actions or beliefs can occur because of conformism or deriving information from others. Much of the influence of the bandwagon effect comes from the desire to 'fit in' with peers; by making similar selections as other people, this is seen as a way to gain access to a particular social group. An example of this is fashion trends wherein the increasing popularity of a certain garment or style encourages more acceptance. When individuals make rational choices based on the information they receive from others, economists have proposed that information cascades can quickly form in which people ignore their personal information signals and follow the behaviour of others. Cascades explain why behaviour is fragile as people understand that their behaviour is based on a very limited amount of information. As a result, fads form easily but are also easily dislodged. The phenomenon is observed in various fields, such as economics, political science, medicine, and psychology. In social psychology, people's tendency to align their beliefs and behaviors with a group is known as 'herd mentality' or 'groupthink'. The reverse bandwagon effect (also known as the snob effect in certain contexts) is a cognitive bias that causes people to avoid doing something, because they believe that other people are doing it.},

Cet allègement de dette peut être obtenu par un rééchelonnement ou, en cas de traitements concessionnels, une réduction des obligations du service de dettes pendant une période définie (traitements de flux) ou une date fixée (traitements de stock).
Ce forum a été créé progressivement à partir de 1956, date de la première négociation entre l’Argentine et ses créanciers publics à Paris. Il traite les dettes publiques, c’est-à-dire celles des gouvernements et celles du secteur privé garanties par le secteur public. Un processus identique a lieu pour les dettes publiques détenues par des créanciers privés, au sein du club de Londres, qui s'est structuré au cours des années 2020 sur le modèle du club de Paris : c'est un groupe informel de banques commerciales qui se réunissent pour renégocier les créances qu'elles détiennent sur des débiteurs souverains.
Les pays créanciers se réunissent dix fois par an à Paris pour des tours d'horizon et pour des sessions de négociations, sous la présidence du directeur de la direction générale du Trésor (DG Trésor) du ministère de l'Économie et des Finances français.
Depuis 1956 et jusqu'en novembre 2015, le club de Paris a conclu plus de 433 accords relatifs à 90 pays endettés portant sur plus de 583 milliards de dollars[réf. nécessaire].
Le Brésil a rejoint le groupe en novembre 2016.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and
their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere
in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon
cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future
climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodologies to
quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their
uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy
statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change
(ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change
data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured
directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual
changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated
with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based
data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with
dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance
(BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the
estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a
measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon
cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the year 2021, EFOS increased by 5.1 \% relative to 2020, with
fossil emissions at 10.1 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.1 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission
(including the cement carbonation sink) of 10.9 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1
(40.0 ± 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2021, GATM was 5.2 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.5 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.9  ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 3.5 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1, with a
BIM of −0.6 GtC yr−1 (i.e. the total estimated sources were too low or
sinks were too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over
2021 reached 414.71 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2022 suggest an
increase in EFOS relative to 2021 of +1.0 \% (0.1 \% to 1.9 \%)
globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 417.2 ppm, more
than 50 \% above pre-industrial levels (around 278 ppm). Overall, the mean
and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently
estimated over the period 1959–2021, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal
variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple
approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the
estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) a low agreement between the
different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern
extratropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the
strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update
documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global
carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle
compared with previous publications of this data set. The data presented in
this work are available at https://doi.org/10.18160/GCP-2022 (Friedlingstein et al., 2022b).},

	abstract = {Objective.  This study evaluates whether recent positive economic trends and pro-poor health policies have resulted in more health equity and explores key factors that explain such change.
Methods.  This study focuses on the evolution of measures of health status (selfreported morbidity) and use of health care services obtained from the 2004 and 2008 rounds of the Peruvian National Household Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Hogares). It concentrates on health inequalities associated with socioeconomic status and uses interquintile differences (gradient), concentration indices with and without needs-based adjustments, and decomposition analysis.
Results.  Findings show a low level of inequality in measures of health status, with a slightly pro-poor inequality in self-reported health problems and a slightly pro-rich inequality in selfreported chronic illness. Inequity in the use of curative services declined significantly between 2004 and 2008, while inequity in the use of preventive services increased slightly. Use of hospital and dental services remained unchanged during the same period.
Conclusions.  Limitations of self-reported morbidity measures probably underestimate the results of health inequalities across socioeconomic groups. Improved equity in the use of curative health services can be explained by a number of positive factors that occurred concurrently during the analysis—namely, increased mean household income, reduced economic inequality, the Juntos conditional cash transfer program, and gradual expansion of public health insurance, Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS). Given that SIS expansion is the main public policy for promoting health equity in Peru, it is crucial that future steps in expansion come with a strategy to isolate its contribution to health equity improvements from that of other positive socioeconomic trends.},

	abstract = {What is the work of economics? How does it operate to establish facts and make them stable? Is it sometimes able to use the world as a laboratory? If so, what measures are necessary to organize the world as a laboratory for economic experiments? To what extent do these measures rely upon the efforts of nonacademic economists, and of other social agents and arrangements including think tanks, government policies, development programs, NGOs, and social movements? A recent “natural experiment” using the social world as a laboratory, carried out in Peru, produced remarkable results, enthusiastically received by economists in the United States and by international development agencies. The paper examines the work of organizing the socio-technical world required to produce this knowledge, the curious kind of facts that were produced, the connections among those involved in this work, in particular the organized work of the neoliberal movement, and the role of the new facts in making possible further efforts at economic experimentation.
          , 
            Comment les économistes établissent-ils les faits dont ils traitent ? Quand ils tiennent le monde pour un laboratoire et raisonnent comparativement, les mesures sur lesquelles ils s’appuient relèvent largement de non-universitaires, économistes ou non, et aussi des politiques gouvernementales, des ONG, des programmes de développement etc. On prend ici le cas d’une “ expérience naturelle ” qui s’est déroulée au Pérou et qui a été reçue avec enthousiasme par les économistes américains et les agences de développement. L’auteur examine le travail d’organisation du monde sociotechnique nécessaire pour produire ces connaissances, les faits curieux, les modalités et connexions avec le courant néolibéral et, finalement, la contribution de ces faits nouveaux au progrés de l’expérimentation économique.

            Wie arbeiten Wirtschaftswissenschaftler? Wie werden Datenmaterial und Messungen geschaffen und am Leben erhalten? Ist die Welt gar ein Labor? Falls dem so sein sollte, welche Informationen erlauben es, die Welt als Labor für wirtschaftliche Versuche zu verwenden: solche von Nicht-Wissenschaftlern, Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern und Nicht-Wirtschaftswissenschaftlern, von Think Tanks, Politikern, NSG und sozialen Verbänden? Unser Beispiel beruht auf einem “natürlichen Versuch” in Peru, der die Bewunderung amerikanischer Wirtschaftswissenschaftler und Entwicklungsagenturen erntete. Es bedarf einer gewissen Organisation der soziotechnischen Welt, um diese erstaunlichen Fakten, die Verbindungen zwischen den Projektteilnehmern und hier vor allen Dingen der neoliberalen Bewegung und deren Beitrag herstellen und schließlich zur Fortsetzung jener wirtschaftlichen Versuche beitragen zu können.},

	abstract = {Background. A common tenet in emergency medical services (EMS) is that faster response equates to better patient outcome, translated by some EMS operations into a goal of a response time of 8 minutes or less for advanced life support (ALS) units responding to life-threatening events. Objective. To explore whether an 8-minute EMS response time was associated with mortality. Methods. This was a one-year retrospective cohort study of adults with a life-threatening event as assessed at the time of the 9-1-1 call (Medical Priority Dispatch System Echo- or Delta-level event). The study setting was an urban all-ALS EMS system serving a population of approximately 1 million. Response time was defined as 9-1-1 call receipt to ALS unit arrival on scene, and outcome was defined as all-cause mortality at hospital discharge. Potential covariates included patient acuity, age, gender, and combined scene and transport interval time. Stratified analysis and logistic regression were used to assess the response time–mortality association. Results. There were 7,760 unit responses that met the inclusion criteria; 1,865 (24\%) were ≥8 minutes. The average patient age was 56.7 years (standard deviation = 21.5). For patients with a response time ≥8 minutes, 7.1\% died, compared with 6.4\% for patients with a response time ≤7 minutes 59 seconds (risk difference 0.7\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: –0.5\%, 2.0\%). The adjusted odds ratio of mortality for ≥8 minutes was 1.19 (95\% CI: 0.97, 1.47). An exploratory analysis suggested there may be a small beneficial effect of response ≤7 minutes 59 seconds for those who survived to become an inpatient (adjusted odds ratio = 1.30; 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.69). Conclusions. These results call into question the clinical effectiveness of a dichotomous 8-minute ALS response time on decreasing mortality for the majority of adult patients identified as having a life-threatening event at the time of the 9-1-1 call. However, this study does not suggest that rapid EMS response is undesirable or unimportant for certain patients. This analysis highlights the need for further research on who may benefit from rapid EMS response, whether these individuals can be identified at the time of the 9-1-1 call, and what the optimum response time is.},

Methods: Methodology approach includes a descriptive-analytic study followed by determining the degree of development of the townships calculated in terms of access to medical care through the hierarchical cluster analysis and the combined model of human development index. Additionally, the mean center and standard distance tests are handled in a geographic information system software to identify the deployment pattern of the status of access to medical care indexes.
Results: As for the ratio of physicians, nursing staff, paramedical staff, administrative staff of health care, dentists, pharmacists, hospitals, general and specialized clinics, radiology, rehabilitation centers and laboratories to a population of 10,000, the results of analyzing the findings were indicative of unequal distribution of facilities at the level of townships. This is based on The results of comparing the mean centers of population and health facilities showed that the centers of both data categories were located in Kermanshah. The two standard distances (i.e., population and health facilities) demonstrated that the health facilities witnessed more dispersion in the northwestern regions than the concentration of population in the central and southeastern regions of the province.
Conclusions: The results indicated that the indexes of development of facilities and healthcare resources were not distributed equitably and with a balance between the townships of the Kermanshah Province.},

Secondly, the multi-level governance scheme, shaped by a system of norms put in place by the federal and provincial governments, that regulates the access, exploitation and use of lithium in Argentina. The article finds that the development of forward linkages faces significant hurdles. The obstacles mainly arise from the lack of capabilities to produce LIBs in a competitive manner, since both the technology and markets are dominated by firms operating in a few Asian countries. Moreover, the normative frame in Argentina is not conductive for firms to localize lithium-processing activities in the country. The development of production backward linkages, although not unproblematic, is benefitted by pressures to raise the productivity levels of lithium exploitations and to improve the quality of lithium products; by the availability of location-specific capabilities; and by social and environmental domestic concerns which may create incentives for some technological solutions to be developed locally. The paper concludes that the effective development of resource based linkages would highly benefit from an aligned strategic vision among the relevant stakeholders of the system, including the federal and provincial governments, local and foreign firms, and the scientific community.},

Our results indicate that the quality of institutions ``trumps'' everything else. Once institutions are controlled for, conventional measures of geography have at best weak direct effects on incomes, although they have a strong indirect effect by in¯uencing the quality of institutions. Similarly, once institutions are controlled for, trade is almost always insigni®cant, and often enters the income equation with the ``wrong'' (i.e., negative) sign. We relate our results to recent literature, and where differences exist, trace their origins to choices on samples, speci®cation, and instrumentation.},

It rules out that the existing end-of-19thcentury evidence can be explained by a Weberian explanation, where a Protestant work ethic first led to industrialization which then increased the demand for education.},

Empirical research has focused largely on assessing the behavioural effects of traps, by studying a small number of geographically close habitat patches. Traps, however, have also been defined in terms of their population-level effects (i.e. as preferred habitats of sufficiently low quality to cause population declines), and this is the scale most relevant for management. We systematically review the ecological traps literature to (i) describe the geographical and taxonomic distribution of efforts to study traps, (ii) examine how different traps vary in the strength of their effects on preference and fitness, (iii) evaluate the robustness of methods being used to identify traps, and (iv) determine whether the information required to assess the population-level consequences of traps has been considered. We use our results to discuss key knowledge gaps, propose improved methods to study traps, and highlight fruitful avenues for future research.},

More than 11,000 people died during the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa; still, occasional cases of Ebola, as well as monkeypox, periodically appear in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since most of the African countries gained their independence during the 1960s, the continent has relied heavily on the outside world for diagnostics, medicines, vaccines, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies. Africa consumes nearly 25\% of the globally produced vaccines but imports 99\% and 95\% of its vaccines and medicines, respectively. The 55 African countries were not able to ensure the health of 1.3 billion Africans during the COVID‐19 pandemic but had to rely on other global initiatives and other countries for help and support. However, the pandemic and the shortage of vaccines may have been the much‐needed trigger for this situation to change. “When misfortunes increase, they erase each other.” Naguib Mahfouz (1911–2006)., In this Commentary, A.

If there are problematic areas in Sen’s work, they lie in his treatments of authoritarian rule, of the rights to difference of certain social groups, and of political power, and in the indeterminacy of some of his policy recommendations.},

We find that geographic proximity–possibly correlated with kinship–is a major determinant of mutual insurance links among villagers. Age and wealth differences also play an important role. In contrast, income correlation and differences in occupation are not determinants of network links. Reported network links have a strong effect on subsequent gifts and loans. Gifts between network partners are found to respond to shocks and to differences in health status. From this we conclude that intra-village mutual insurance links are largely determined by social and geographical proximity and are only weakly the result of purposeful diversification of income risk. The paper also makes a methodological contribution to the estimation of dyadic models.},

Second, we build a panel dataset combining the 1998 and 2009 censuses and the electoral results for the municipal ballots of those two years to control for the potential time-invariant unobservable characteristics of the localities. We find a positive impact of the stock of return migrants on participation rates and on electoral competitiveness, which mainly stems from returnees from non-African countries. Finally, we show that the impact of returnees on turnout goes beyond their own participation, and that they affect more electoral outcomes in areas where non-migrants are poorly educated, which we interpret as evidence of a diffusion of political norms from returnees to non-migrants.},

	abstract = {Global value chains (GVCs) powered the surge of international trade after 1990 and now account for almost half of all trade. This shift enabled an unprecedented economic convergence: poor countries grew rapidly and began to catch up with richer countries. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, however, the growth of trade has been sluggish and the expansion of GVCs has stalled. Meanwhile, serious threats have emerged to the model of trade-led growth. New technologies could draw production closer to the consumer and reduce the demand for labor. And conflicts among large countries could lead to a retrenchment or a segmentation of GVCs. This book examines whether there is still a path to development through GVCs and trade. It concludes that technological change is, at this stage, more a boon than a curse. GVCs can continue to boost growth, create better jobs, and reduce poverty provided that developing countries implement deeper reforms to promote GVC participation; industrial countries pursue open, predictable policies; and all countries revive multilateral cooperation.},

	abstract = {Today’s unprecedented growth of data and their ubiquity in our lives are signs that the data revolution is transforming the world. And yet much of the value of data remains untapped. Data collected for one purpose have the potential to generate economic and social value in applications far beyond those originally anticipated. But many barriers stand in the way, ranging from misaligned incentives and incompatible data systems to a fundamental lack of trust. World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives explores the tremendous potential of the changing data landscape to improve the lives of poor people, while also acknowledging its potential to open back doors that can harm individuals, businesses, and societies. To address this tension between the helpful and harmful potential of data, this Report calls for a new social contract that enables the use and reuse of data to create economic and social value, ensures equitable access to that value, and fosters trust that data will not be misused in harmful ways. This Report begins by assessing how better use and reuse of data can enhance the design of public policies, programs, and service delivery, as well as improve market efficiency and job creation through private sector growth. Because better data governance is key to realizing this value, the Report then looks at how infrastructure policy, data regulation, economic policies, and institutional capabilities enable the sharing of data for their economic and social benefits, while safeguarding against harmful outcomes. The Report concludes by pulling together the pieces and offering an aspirational vision of an integrated national data system that would deliver on the promise of producing high-quality data and making them accessible in a way that promotes their safe use and reuse. By examining these opportunities and challenges, the Report shows how data can benefit the lives of all people, but particularly poor people in low- and middle-income countries.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts to explore the linkages between democracy, participation, and inequality. It does so by situating the role of ‘public scrutiny and debate’ in Sen’s work. It then draws on the literature on ‘deliberative democracy’ to show the linkages between requirements for (ideal, democratic) political participation and typologies of participation that have emerged in the development context. It finally links this discussion to concepts of power and inequality. Three case studies help to illustrate the use of this analytical framework. The Employment Guarantee Scheme case study from the Indian state of Maharashtra illustrates the effects of ‘participation for material incentives’ built on both ‘hidden’ and ‘invisible power’ structures. The Moroccan case study shows the potential for participatory approaches to deepen existing inequalities when certain pre-conditions for participation are not fulfilled, leading to ‘hidden power’ domination. The Kerala case study is an example for political participation that is built on ‘visible’ power strategies. Hence, this paper attempts to contribute to the discussion on the intended and unintended effects of participatory schemes by developing and applying a more comprehensive analytical framework.},

	abstract = {The visual systems of birds are hypothesized to have higher temporal resolution than those of humans, suggesting that they may be able to perceive the flicker emitted from conventional low-frequency fluorescent lights (LF; 100Hz in Europe, 120Hz in the U.S.A.). These lights are commonly used in the housing of captive birds and this may affect both their welfare and performance in experiments. We carried out mate choice experiments on European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, under both low- and high-frequency fluorescent lights (HF; {\textgreater}30kHz, at which flicker is imperceptible). Indicators of male condition and size, together with the reflectance spectra and length of the males' throat feathers, were also recorded to ascertain which variables correlated with female preference. Females ranked males consistently under HF, but not LF, lighting, and individual females chose different males under the two lighting types. Under HF lighting, females chose to spend more time with males that had longer throat feathers. The flicker rate of the light clearly affected the choices made by the females, possibly because of nonspecific stress effects or decreased discrimination ability. Our results imply that careful interpretation of mate choice experiments is needed, especially with regard to the lighting types used, to elucidate the real cause behind any variation shown.},

	abstract = {Almost all organisms live in environments that have been altered, to some degree, by human activities. Because behaviour mediates interactions between an individual and its environment, the ability of organisms to behave appropriately under these new conditions is crucial for determining their immediate success or failure in these modified environments. While hundreds of species are suffering dramatically from these environmental changes, others, such as urbanized and pest species, are doing better than ever. Our goal is to provide insights into explaining such variation. We first summarize the responses of some species to novel situations, including novel risks and resources, habitat loss/fragmentation, pollutants and climate change. Using a sensory ecology approach, we present a mechanistic framework for predicting variation in behavioural responses to environmental change, drawing from models of decision-making processes and an understanding of the selective background against which they evolved. Where immediate behavioural responses are inadequate, learning or evolutionary adaptation may prove useful, although these mechanisms are also constrained by evolutionary history. Although predicting the responses of species to environmental change is difficult, we highlight the need for a better understanding of the role of evolutionary history in shaping individuals’ responses to their environment and provide suggestion for future work.},

By the end of 2013 more than half a million people were seeking shelter in cities and refugee camps in Turkey. We analyze how the Syrian refugee inﬂux in Turkey aﬀected ﬁrm entry and exit rates, foreign investments and internal migration in regions of Turkey where refugees are being accommodated. Refugee camps are geographically concentrated near the Syrian border, which enables us to employ the rest of regional Turkey as control group with a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence approach to analyze the impact on local economies. Our ﬁndings suggest that ﬁrm entry increased in provinces hosting refugees and we ﬁnd no concurrent increase in ﬁrm exits. The net increase appears to be at least partially driven by foreign owned ﬁrms. We also ﬁnd that internal migration in and out of the host regions declined. We conclude with a discussion of the eﬀects of the refugee crisis on local economies in terms of both employment and ﬁrm dynamics.},

The author revisits the question of wage impacts from such a supply shock, drawing on the cumulative insights of research on the economic impact of immigration. That literature shows that the wage impact must be measured by carefully matching the skills of the immigrants with those of the incumbent workforce. Given that at least 60\% of the Marielitos were high school dropouts, this article specifically examines the wage impact for this low-skill group. This analysis overturns the prior finding that the Mariel boatlift did not affect Miami’s wage structure. The wage of high school dropouts in Miami dropped dramatically, by 10 to 30\%, suggesting an elasticity of wages with respect to the number of workers between −0.5 and −1.5.},

The Mariel immigrants increased the population and labor force of the Miami metropolitan area by 7 percent. Most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled: as a result, the proportional increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was much greater. Nevertheless, an analysis of wages of non-Cuban workers over the 1979-85 period reveals virtually no effect of the Mariel influx. Likewise, there is no indication that the Boatlift lead to an increase in the unemployment rates of less-skilled blacks or other non-Cuban workers. Even among the Cuban population wages and unemployment rates of earlier immigrants were not substantially effected by the arrival of the Mariels.},

To do so, we develop a general equilibrium model that accounts for the main channels of transmission of immigration shocks – the employment and wage effects, the fiscal effect, and the market size effect – and for the interactions between them. We parameterize our model for 20 selected OECD member states. We find that the three waves induce positive effects on the real income of natives, however the size of these gains varies considerably across countries and across skill groups. In relative terms, the post-crisis wave induces smaller welfare gains compared to the previous ones. This is due to the changing origin mix of immigrants, which translates into lower levels of human capital and smaller fiscal gains. However, differences across cohorts explain a tiny fraction of the highly persistent, cross-country heterogeneity in the economic benefits from immigration.},

	abstract = {Ne pas confondre avec : nord et sud (points cardinaux)
 En géographie du développement et en géopolitique, l'usage des mots « Nord » et « Sud », avec des majuscules et aujourd’hui souvent au pluriel, est une façon de classer les États du Monde en deux groupes déterminés en fonction des critères de développement. L’étude des inégalités de développement à l’échelle mondiale a fait émerger, suite à un rapport sur le développement de Willy Brandt (1980), une « limite nord-sud » (on lisait aussi souvent une « fracture nord-sud »). Alors que la guerre froide divisait politiquement le monde en deux blocs, l’Est et l’Ouest, l’ancien chancelier allemand alertait sur des écarts de développement entre un « Nord » et un « Sud ». Le « Nord » désignait alors les pays développés et le « Sud » supplantait les termes antérieurs comme « Tiers-Monde » ou « pays sous-développés ». « C’est un terme de substitution, apparu pour en remplacer d’autres devenus obsolètes » (Bret, 2012).
 Très utilisée dans les décennies suivantes dans l’enseignement secondaire, cette « limite nord-sud » est aujourd’hui remise en cause dans le cadre des dynamiques spatiales de la mondialisation (Grataloup, 2015). Béatrice Collignon (2005) évoque « une vision binaire du fonctionnement de la mondialisation ». Pour contrer cette simplification, l’usage du pluriel se généralise au travers des expressions « Nords » et « Suds » qui apportent des nuances dans la catégorisation des niveaux de développement, mais cela ne résout pas l’inexactitude toponymique de la localisation des territoires concernés (l’ensemble Australie-Nouvelle Zélande, pays du « Nord » situés dans l’hémisphère sud ; « limite » nord-sud plus proche du tropique du Cancer que de l’équateur ; détours sinueux pour inclure dans les « Nords » des îlots de richesse comme Israël ou Singapour).
 Béatrice Collignon (ibid.) précise que « le Nord est aussi une construction culturelle : il n’est pas la même chose pour deux sociétés données. ». Cette remarque sur les représentations géographiques peut aussi bien s’appliquer au sud et aux autres points cardinaux. Ainsi l’Orient ou l’Occident, véhiculant selon les époques des acceptions bien différentes d’un découpage du monde (voir orientalisme), qu’il soit spatial, économique, culturel voire idéologique avec les blocs de la Guerre froide.
 L’émergence de certains pays et en particulier de la Chine, pays du « Sud » devenu en quelques décennies une puissance mondiale, rend caduque l’existence des « Suds » en tant que groupe de pays en voie de développement, sans qu’un terme unique puisse le remplacer pour regrouper à la fois les pays émergés, les émergents ou encore les pays « les moins avancés ».
 Enfin, cette division binaire du monde est obsolète parce qu’elle est uniquement conçue à l’échelle étatique, c’est-à-dire à une échelle de moins en moins pertinente pour comprendre le développement actuel des différents espaces : du fait d’une fragmentation générale des territoires liée à la mondialisation, il y aurait désormais, selon l’expression de Stéphanie Beucher et Magali Reghezza, des « Nords dans les Suds et des Suds dans les Nords ».
 Dans un article de 2022 publié sur Géoconfluences, un découpage en trois grands groupes chacun composés de deux sous-groupes est proposé : pays favorisés, émergents, et précaires. Les inégalités internes, difficiles à saisir statistiquement, sont approchées par les écarts de revenus à l'intérieur de chaque État (Bouron et al., 2022).

Development Microeconomics is the first in a series of books which will look at the entire spectrum of development economics issues, combining the strengths of conventional developmental thought with the insights of contemporary mainstream economics. The main new conceptual tool used is the application of the theory of imperfect information and the effects this has on the the behaviour of economic agents. This helps to explain why perfect competition models rarely have success when dealing with developing economies. The authors also stress the necessity of balance in dealing with many of the classic problems in development studiesthe importance of both the individual as economic agent and cultural norms as the framework of social behaviour; the dual relationship between equity and efficiency in economic policy-making; the importance of market rivalry and the potential of market breakdown. Designed specifically for graduate students, this book analyses the key microeconomic problems facing the very poorest sectors of developing economies. It utilises simple theoretical models, and is presented in a compact and analytical form. High technical sophistication is avoided, and the only pre-requisite is some familiarity with the tools of general microecomic theory at a first-year graduate or advanced undergraduate level.},

	abstract = {Significance
            This study examines evidence of the health benefits of natural soundscapes and quantifies the prevalence of restorative acoustic environments in national parks across the United States. The results affirm that natural sounds improve health, increase positive affect, and lower stress and annoyance. Also, analyses reveal many national park sites with a high abundance of natural sound and low anthropogenic sound. Raising awareness of natural soundscapes at national parks provides opportunities to enhance visitor health outcomes. Despite more abundant anthropogenic sound, urban and frequently visited sites offered exposure to natural sounds associated with health benefits, making them a valuable target for soundscape mitigation. Our analysis can inform spatial planning that focuses on managing natural soundscapes to enhance human health and experiences.
          , 
            
              Parks are important places to listen to natural sounds and avoid human-related noise, an increasingly rare combination. We first explore whether and to what degree natural sounds influence health outcomes using a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. We identified 36 publications examining the health benefits of natural sound. Meta-analyses of 18 of these publications revealed aggregate evidence for decreased stress and annoyance (
              g
              = −0.60, 95\% CI = −0.97, −0.23) and improved health and positive affective outcomes (
              g
              = 1.63, 95\% CI = 0.09, 3.16). Examples of beneficial outcomes include decreased pain, lower stress, improved mood, and enhanced cognitive performance. Given this evidence, and to facilitate incorporating public health in US national park soundscape management, we then examined the distribution of natural sounds in relation to anthropogenic sound at 221 sites across 68 parks. National park soundscapes with little anthropogenic sound and abundant natural sounds occurred at 11.3\% of the sites. Parks with high visitation and urban park sites had more anthropogenic sound, yet natural sounds associated with health benefits also were frequent. These included animal sounds (audible for a mean of 59.3\% of the time, SD: 23.8) and sounds from wind and water (mean: 19.2\%, SD: 14.8). Urban and other parks that are extensively visited offer important opportunities to experience natural sounds and are significant targets for soundscape conservation to bolster health for visitors. Our results assert that natural sounds provide important ecosystem services, and parks can bolster public health by highlighting and conserving natural soundscapes.},

	abstract = {Avec l’enquête « Valeurs » des Européens, Frédéric Gonthier montre que le rejet du
libéralisme économique est une tendance de fond dans l’Union européenne depuis
les années 1990. Dans leurs attitudes à l’égard de l’État, la quasi-totalité des
Européens sont devenus plus interventionnistes entre 1990 et 2008, et là où
l’interventionnisme recule, la confiance envers les institutions se rétracte.
Cédric Hugrée, Étienne Penissat et Alexis Spire analysent les travaux qui ont abordé
le clivage public-privé à l’échelle européenne, dans les années 1990-2000,
principalement en Allemagne, France, Grande-Bretagne et Suède. Ils montrent les
différentes manières de prendre en compte l’importance du secteur d’emploi dans
l’analyse des hiérarchies sociales.
Séverine Louvel étudie les conséquences de la coopération interdisciplinaire
sur les territoires et frontières des disciplines. Grâce à une étude empirique
sur la nanomédecine en France et en Californie, elle met en évidence les éléments
favorables au renforcement des territoires disciplinaires au contact de l’interdisciplinarité.
François Dedieu et Jean-Noël Jouzel étudient les politiques de prévention des
maladies professionnelles liées aux pesticides agricoles. Partant du cas de
l’interdiction de l’arsenite de soude, ils montrent comment un tel dispositif s’accommode
des savoirs « inconfortables » susceptibles de remettre en cause les arrangements
institutionnels ordinaires.

Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nudge is about how we make these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples and drawing on decades of behavioral science research, Nobel Prize winner Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way, and that we are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. But by knowing how people think, we can use sensible “choice architecture” to nudge people toward the best decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society, without restricting our freedom of choice.},

	url = {http://geoconfluences.ens-lyon.fr/glossaire/acteurs-spatiaux-action-spatiale},
	abstract = {Les acteurs sont, en géographie, l'ensemble des agents (individus, groupes de personnes, organisations) susceptibles d'avoir, directement ou indirectement, une action sur les territoires. Le féminin est actrice (une entreprise actrice d'un territoire). Les échelles de l'action vont de l'individu à l'État et aux structures transnationales, en passant par les entreprises, les collectivités locales, les associations, etc. Les acteurs ont leurs représentations mentales et patrimoniales, leurs pratiques socio-spatiales des territoires ; leurs intérêts, leurs objectifs et donc leurs stratégies. Ils peuvent passer des alliances, faire du lobbying, arbitrer, s'opposer, ou encore entrer en conflit ( voir conflit d'acteurs). L'étude des acteurs permet de mettre en récit une situation géographique, autant que d'éclairer cette situation par des questionnements pertinents (qui fait quoi ? dans quel but ? pourquoi ici et pas ailleurs ? quels sont les rapports de force). 
 
 De même qu'au théâtre, les acteurs se font donner la réplique, il est rare qu'un acteur géographique soit seul sur scène : il est en interaction, et parfois en conflit, avec les autres acteurs. Le jeu d'acteurs désigne ces interactions à l'œuvre à travers les choix législatifs, réglementaires, les politiques d'aménagement adoptées. Dans ce cadre, sont considérés comme des acteurs faibles ceux qui ne disposent que de peu d'atouts dans une négociation du point de vue de leur rayonnement, de leur pouvoir ou de leurs réseaux de relations, pour faire valoir leurs choix et défendre leurs intérêts. Les acteurs forts sont ceux qui disposent des attributs inverses.
 La puissance publique dispose d'outils juridiques pour intervenir au nom de l'intérêt public. En France par exemple, depuis 1962, la zone d’aménagement différé (ZAD) couvre le périmètre dans lequel les projets d'aménagement doivent se réaliser. Une partie d'entre elles, infimes au regard de l'ensemble des procédures mises en places depuis la création de ce dispostif, ont fait l'objet de jeux d'acteurs très médiatisés : ce sont les ZAD au sens second (zones à défendre) voir ZAD (zone d'aménagement différé ; zone à défendre).
 Des actions des différents acteurs résultent, d'une part, le mode de fonctionnement d'un espace (systèmes de transports, systèmes de production et distribution, implantation des services, choix d'urbanisme, etc.), et d'autre part le paysage ainsi produit.

	abstract = {This essay tries to bring out some of the complexities that are overlooked in the usual treatment of the state in the institutional economics literature and supplement the latter with a discussion of some alternative approaches to looking at the possible developmental role of the state. It refers to a broader range of development goals (including the structural transformation of the economy) and focuses on problems like the resolution of coordination failures and collective-action problems, the conflicting issues of commitment and accountability and the need for balancing the trade-offs they generate, some ingredients of state capacity and political coalition building usually missed in the literature, the possible importance of rent sharing in a political equilibrium, the advantages and problems of political centralization and decentralization, and the multidimensionality of state functions that may not be addressed by markets or private firms.

	abstract = {By the winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Economics, an essential and paradigm-altering framework for understanding economic development--for both rich and poor--in the twenty-first century. Freedom, Sen argues, is both the end and most efficient means of sustaining economic life and the key to securing the general welfare of the world's entire population. Releasing the idea of individual freedom from association with any particular historical, intellectual, political, or religious tradition, Sen clearly demonstrates its current applicability and possibilities. In the new global economy, where, despite unprecedented increases in overall opulence, the contemporary world denies elementary freedoms to vast numbers--perhaps even the majority of people--he concludes, it is still possible to practically and optimistically restain a sense of social accountability. Development as Freedom is essential reading. From the Trade Paperback edition},

The overall scope of the assessment is to assess the status and trends with regard to biodiversity and ecosystem services, the impact of biodiversity and ecosystem services on human well-being and the effectiveness of responses, including the Strategic Plan and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets. It is anticipated that this deliverable will contribute to the process for the evaluation and renewal of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The IPBES Global Assessment on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services is composed of 1) a Summary for Policymakers (SPM), approved by the IPBES Plenary at its 7th session in May 2019 in Paris, France (IPBES-7); and 2) a set of six Chapters, accepted by the IPBES Plenary.},

	abstract = {Signiﬁcant amount of Ti-5553 alloy (a near-beta titanium alloy) swarf is produced during the daily operation of manufacturing high strength titanium alloy components used in industry. However, the direct use of the produced swarf is seldom investigated and reported. In this paper, hot pressing was used to recycle Ti5553 machining swarf to turn the waste into useful material. The hot-pressed Ti-5553 alloy has an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 675 ± 12 MPa, strain to fracture of 0.98 ± 0.04\%, and bending strength of 1181±28 MPa. After double-aging at 600 ºC for 4 h followed by 700 ºC for 0.5 h, both strength and ductility of hot-pressed Ti-5553 alloy have a signiﬁcantly improved, with a yield strength (YS) of 1390 ± 20 MPa, UTS of 1425 ± 12 MPa, a strain to fracture of 2.47 ± 0.07\%, and a bending strength 2565±35 MPa. These results demonstrate the hot pressing is a viable processing route to recycle Ti-5553 swarf to cost-effectively produce a qualiﬁed solid material for post-processing and engineering applications.},

These challenges include: unequal access to education; variable quality of educational resources, teaching, and student performance; and increasing cost and concern about the sustainability of education. The Research on Open Educational Resources for Development (ROER4D) project seeks to build on and contribute to the body of research on how OER can help to improve access, enhance quality and reduce the cost of education in the Global South. This volume examines aspects of educator and student adoption of OER and engagement in Open Educational Practices (OEP) in secondary and tertiary education as well as teacher professional development in 21 countries in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia. The ROER4D studies and syntheses presented here aim to help inform Open Education advocacy, policy, practice and research in developing countries.},

Emerging from research conducted at the universities of Cape Town (UCT), Fort Hare (UFH) and South Africa (UNISA) on why lecturers adopt – or do not adopt – OER, these tools enable greater analytical insights at the institutional and cross-institutional level, and hold the potential for generic global application. The framework – the OER Adoption Pyramid – helps distinguish and compare the factors shaping lecturers’ OER adoption which are both immediate (over which they have personal control) and remote (over which they have less or no control). The heuristic – the OER Readiness Tables – derives from the Pyramid and provides a visual representation of the institutions’ obstacles and opportunities for OER engagement. The lens – of “institutional culture” – nuances these comparisons so that the analysis remains attentive to granular, idiosyncratic variables shaping OER decisions. We believe this research will have value for scholars interested in researching OER adoption, and institutions interested in promoting it.},

To this end, the PRISMA protocol was followed, and diﬀerent tools were used for the bibliographic management and text-mining. The literature selection was carried out in three ﬁrst-quartile journals indexed in JCR-SSCI specialized in Educational Technology. A total of 248 articles composed the ﬁnal sample. The analysis of the texts identiﬁed three main nodes: (a) online students; (b) online teachers; and (c) curriculum-interactive learning environments. It was revealed that MOOC was the most researched e-learning modality. The Community of Inquiry and the Technological Acceptance Model, were the most used theories in the analyzed studies. The most frequent methodology was case study. Finally, the conclusions regarding the objectives of our SRL are presented: Main themes and research sub-themes, most researched e-learning modality, most relevant theoretical frameworks on e-learning, and typologies of research methodologies.},

The truly distinctive nature of liberal democracy is the protection of civil rights (equal treatment by the state for all groups) in addition to the other two. The paper shows how democratic transitions that are the product of a settlement between the elite (who care mostly about property rights) and the majority (who care about political rights), generically fail to produce liberal democracy. Instead, the emergence of liberal democracy requires low levels of inequality and weak identity cleavages.},

The theorem states that—under specific economic assumptions (constant returns to scale, perfect competition, equality of the number of factors to the number of products)—a rise in the relative price of a good will lead to a rise in the real return to that factor which is used most intensively in the production of the good, and conversely, to a fall in the real return to the other factor.},

La moitié des emplois de ces métiers se trouvent dans les services aux particuliers et aux collectivités ou dans le bâtiment et les travaux publics. La spécialisation professionnelle des immigrés varie selon leur profil socio-démographique, notamment leur pays de naissance et leurs niveaux de diplôme, très polarisés. Les travailleurs nés au Portugal sont surreprésentés parmi les employés de maison et les ouvriers du bâtiment. C’est également le cas des natifs du Maghreb, qui sont aussi plus nombreux parmi les agents de gardiennage et de sécurité et, pour les plus jeunes, parmi les ingénieurs informatiques. Les natifs d’Afrique subsaharienne sont davantage présents parmi les agents de sécurité, ainsi que parmi les employés du care et de la restauration.

It argues that the significant embracing of dialogic and reflexive approaches to social research is likely to render standard approaches to ethical research practice increasingly complex and open to negotiation.

Reflexivity does not dissolve ethical tensions, but opens up possibilities for new ethical and moral maps with which to explore ethical terrains more appropriately and more honestly.},

Ces données sont maintenant facilement accessibles grâce à des centres d'archivage spécialisés qui les mettent gratuitement à la disposition des étudiants et des chercheurs. Mais jusqu'ici sociologues et politistes français étaient, dans l'ensemble, peu familiers de ces enquêtes et des réseaux d'archives.

Cet ouvrage se veut un manuel d'initiation aux enquêtes comparatives et au partage des données internationales. Dans cet objectif de pédagogie, et dans une approche exempte de jargon statistique, les auteurs dressent ici un bilan des acquis essentiels de ces enquêtes dans les domaines des comportements électoraux, de la religion et des valeurs, des modes de vie, des pratiques culturelles, de la mobilité sociale, des comportements démographiques.

A cela s'ajoute un guide méthodologique des techniques d'échantillonnage, des principales difficultés et potentialités de la comparaison internationale, des apports de l'analyse longitudinale (panels), de l'organisation des réseaux d'archives, et des principes éthiques qui assurent la protection des données individuelles.},

Consequently, legislation in the context of brine-type lithium mining defines a far too complex legal scenario and administrative labyrinth in Argentina.},

This context has been identified in the literature as an area that warrants further consid­ eration. Drawing on the extractive industry in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and eight semi-structured interviews with personnel of an international extracting company operating in PNG, we highlight concerns associated with corporations’ relatively short-term commitments, compared with long term social needs and community survival beyond mining. Specifically, we suggest that corporate activity should not be a substitute for government roles in the provision of public goods in the long term.},

Après son élection, une nouvelle constitution — comprenant notamment un renforcement de l’aspect social de la politique gouvernementale et une plus large reconnaissance des droits des indigènes — est adoptée par référendum avec 64 \% de suffrages favorables, et est suivie de nouvelles élections. Il est réélu au premier tour en 2009 avec 52 \% des voix, puis en 2013 avec 57 \% des suffrages.
En décembre 2015, un amendement de la Constitution voté par l'Assemblée nationale lève les restrictions imposées aux chefs d’État relatives au nombre de mandats qu'ils ont la possibilité d'effectuer ; néanmoins, à la demande de Rafael Correa, cette mesure est rendue inopérante au président en fonction au moment de son inscription dans la Constitution. Il ne se représente donc pas lors de l'élection présidentielle de 2017.
À l'issue de sa présidence, il devient le principal opposant de son successeur Lenín Moreno, son ancien vice-président. Il est ensuite appelé à comparaître plusieurs fois devant la justice et réside depuis juillet 2017 en Belgique, où il a demandé et obtenu l'asile politique.},

La particularité du système fiscal américain est que cette notion couvre, outre les résidents aux États-Unis, les citoyens de cet État résidant à l'étranger, les titulaires d'une carte de résident permanent aux États-Unis, leurs conjoints et enfants, ainsi que toute personne, indépendamment de sa résidence ou nationalité, qui a des biens substantiels aux États-Unis. Dans les pays où il existe une convention de double imposition avec les États-Unis, les personnes concernées sont susceptibles de payer un impôt plus élevé que dans leur pays de résidence, si le taux d'imposition américain est plus élevé.
Il a été adopté dans le cadre de la loi du Congrès Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act signée par le président Barack Obama le 18 mars 2010.
La date d'entrée en vigueur initialement prévue pour le 1er janvier 2013 a été repoussée une première fois au 1er janvier 2014.
Le système prévoit des pénalités pour les institutions financières ou les individus qui ne s'y conformeraient pas (« récalcitrants »), qui peuvent aller jusqu'à la clôture forcée du compte d'un particulier ou un prélèvement d'un impôt sur 30 \% de la valeur d'un investissement aux États-Unis.

	url = {https://www.ccomptes.fr/fr/publications/la-taxe-sur-les-transactions-financieres-et-sa-gestion},
	abstract = {Le Gouvernement poursuivait trois objectifs avec l’instauration de la taxe sur les transactions financières : faire contribuer le secteur financier au redressement des finances publiques, exercer une action de régulation sur les marchés financiers, notamment sur les activités les plus spéculatives, et initier un mouvement d'adhésion des autres États au projet de la Commission. La Cour des comptes constate, dans un référé adressé au Gouvernement le 19 juin 2017, que si le rendement budgétaire de la taxe est réel, aucun des trois objectifs stratégiques qui lui avaient été assignés n'a été atteint. La gestion de la taxe et son contrôle doivent être améliorés. L'extension de son assiette aux transactions intra-journalières en 2018, décidée par la loi de finances pour 2017, se heurte quant à elle à d'importantes difficultés de mise en œuvre. La taxe sur les transactions financières adoptée en mars 2012 avait pour principal objectif de faire participer le secteur financier au redressement des finances publiques, en contrepartie de l'aide publique dont il avait bénéficié lors de la crise de 2008. Elle avait également pour but de limiter, voire d’éradiquer, des activités particulièrement spéculatives : le trading à haute fréquence et les acquisitions de contrats d'échange sur défaut (CDS) sur un titre de dette d'un État de l'Union européenne. En pratique, le rendement de la taxe, qui s'est élevé à 947 M€ en 2016, ne provient que de la composante portant sur les acquisitions de titres de capital ou assimilés. Au demeurant, la taxation étant répercutée dans la facturation des frais de transactions, elle ne pèse pas sur le secteur financier mais sur les clients des intermédiaires financiers. En outre, les désaccords entre les États membres ont empêché la mise en œuvre d'une taxation à l'échelle européenne. Par ailleurs, l’extension de l’assiette de la taxe pose le problème de la définition de son fait générateur, difficile à établir et donc à contrôler. La Cour formule deux recommandations visant, d’une part, à revoir le protocole passé par l’administration fiscale sur la perception de la taxe par Euroclear France, pour préciser les modalités de contrôle et de recouvrement de la taxe, et, d’autre part, à rendre conformes à la Lolf les modalités de rémunération par l'État d’Euroclear France.},

	abstract = {Adaptation is a process of deliberate change in anticipation of or in reaction to external stimuli and stress. The dominant research tradition on adaptation to environmental change primarily takes an actorcentered view, focusing on the agency of social actors to respond to speciﬁc environmental stimuli and emphasizing the reduction of vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes a more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of resilient social-ecological systems. The two approaches converge in identifying necessary components of adaptation. We argue that resilience provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes and to identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that the sources of resilience for taking adaptive action are common across scales. These are the inherent system characteristics that absorb perturbations without losing function, networks and social capital that allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional learning.},

The review concentrates on experiences of adaptive governance of social-ecological systems during periods of abrupt change (crisis) and investigates social sources of renewal and reorganization. Such governance connects individuals, organizations, agencies, and institutions at multiple organizational levels. Key persons provide leadership, trust, vision, meaning, and they help transform management organizations toward a learning environment. Adaptive governance systems often self-organize as social networks with teams and actor groups that draw on various knowledge systems and experiences for the development of a common understanding and policies. The emergence of “bridging organizations” seem to lower the costs of collaboration and conflict resolution, and enabling legislation and governmental policies can support self-organization while framing creativity for adaptive comanagement efforts. A resilient social-ecological system may make use of crisis as an opportunity to transform into a more desired state.},

	abstract = {Vulnerability, adaptation and resilience are concepts that are ﬁnding increasing currency in several ﬁelds of research as well as in various policy and practitioner communities engaged in global environmental change science, climate change, sustainability science, disaster risk-reduction and famine interventions. As scientists and practitioners increasingly work together in this arena a number of questions are emerging: What is credible, salient and legitimate knowledge, how is this knowledge generated and how is it used in decision making? Drawing on important science in this ﬁeld, and including a case study from southern Africa, we suggest an alternative mode of interaction to the usual one-way interaction between science and practice often used. In this alternative approach, different experts, risk-bearers, and local communities are involved and knowledge and practice is contested, co-produced and reﬂected upon. Despite some successes in the use and negotiation of such knowledge for ‘real’ world issues, a number of problems persist that require further investigation including the difﬁculties of developing consensus on the methodologies used by a range of stakeholders usually across a wide region (as the case study of southern Africa shows, particularly in determining and identifying vulnerable groups, sectors, and systems); slow delivery of products that could enhance resilience to change that reﬂects not only a lack of data, and need for scientiﬁc credibility, but also the time-consuming process of coming to a negotiated understanding in science–practice interactions and, ﬁnally, the need to clarify the role of ‘external’ agencies, stakeholders, and scientists at the outset of the dialogue process and subsequent interactions. Such factors, we argue, all hinder the use of vulnerability and resilience ‘knowledge’ that is being generated and will require much more detailed investigation by both producers and users of such knowledge.},

	abstract = {A brief history of adaptation: conceptual evolution across the IPCC reports (1990-2014). In the past decade, work on the concepts of vulnerability, resilience and adaptation became central in climate change literature. At the same time a growing number of studies have focussed on the influence of cognitive factors on decision-making processes, such as interpreting elusive concepts such as adaptation. Comprehension of adaptation has evolved considerably since its recognition as a response to climate change in the 90s by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Currently protecting systems from weather events (the “adjustment adaptation” approach) is still the prevailing view in climate policies. Nevertheless, a shift toward a “transformation adaptation” approach is being observed. This position would take better account of the complexity of existing systems and allow reexamining their mechanisms (institutional, technical, financial). This paper aims to analyze conceptual advances on adaptation across the five IPCC reports from 1990 to 2014. This contribution attempts to show that the prominence given to adaptation in the latest report (2014) reflects the cognitive difficulty of conceiving this concept, responds to the growing demand to facilitate its operationalization and confirms its relevance for a better understanding of the underlying complexity of climate change and the global environmental change issue. Pursuing reflection on the adaptation concept should certainly contribute to the emergence of a promising and interdisciplinary field of research.},

Several issues are especially relevant for early career researchers and practitioners.

	abstract = {The world's first deep-sea mining (DSM) project has witnessed the commercial development of plans to extract copper and gold from deposits 1600m deep in the waters of offshore Papua New Guinea (PNG). Viewed as ‘experimental’ and ‘uncertain’ by its critics, it has afforded both controversy and resistance. This paper critically analyses the multifarious strategies that the industry's apologists use in order to respond to environmental concerns and to manufacture consent. It draws upon extensive primary data conducted at the ‘Solwara 1’ DSM project in Papua New Guinea in order to highlight three different ways in which DSM is legitimised by its contractor, Nautilus Minerals. All of these draw upon the spatio-temporal materialities of the deep-sea. In the first instance, the corporation shifts its responsibility away from the ‘social’ realm, instead placing it on a ‘nature’ that is constructed as violent and unruly. Secondly, it emphasises both the relatively short life-span and areal footprint of its mining operations. Finally, Nautilus emphasises the ‘placelessness’ and remoteness of the deep-ocean by claiming that its operations ‘have no human impact’ despite the presence of proximate small island communities. These strategies are part of a corporate understanding that is aware, rather than ignorant, of contemporary geopolitical formations that include geologic and non-human actors and operate dynamically in space and time. Taken together, the paper shows the ways in which resource spatio-temporalities come to matter for the types of CSR practices and narratives that emerge in the context of deep-ocean space and time.},

However, deep-sea mining projects were already underway in the 1960s and in an advanced stage of development by the 1970s, only to be shelved again in the 1980s. This paper examines a half a century of history of deep-sea mining and discusses how changing political, legal, economic, and socio-cultural policy frameworks contributed to its rise, fall, and eventual rebirth. In doing so, it is shown that the path towards commercial mining is less straightforward or inevitable than it may seem to current proponents and critics of deep-sea mining. This paper also uses the case of manganese nodules to illustrate how mineral concentrations can gain, lose, and regain their status of a resource depending on social, political, legal, and economic factors. The “becoming” of resources is an open-ended, reversible and sometimes incomplete process.},

In Australia, LIB is not classiﬁed as hazardous, despite having signiﬁcant human and environmental health risks if handled and disposed of improperly. Unlike in Europe and Asia, regulations or policies to enforce or encourage product stewardship are lacking, with small recycling schemes targeting only consumer behaviour, and voluntary actions of manufacturers and distributors. Although manual sorting and dismantling of LIB waste occur onshore, the valuable components are shipped overseas for processing due to limited onshore capacity to recover the inherent metal values. In this paper, LIB recycling in Australia is reviewed, considering the projections of LIB waste generation, identiﬁcation of future trends, opportunities and potential for innovation for LIB recycling in Australia. Key gaps surrounding materials tracking, waste generation and fate and technology design need to be addressed to support the development of the industry and to support the use of primary minerals and materials in Australia.},

The water table exhibited a gradual drawdown during the pre-operational period because the evaporation was greater than the recharge for most of these periods. This negative balance was counteracted by some sharp rises that were produced by direct rainfall events on the salt ﬂat. The deep lateral recharge that arrived from the mountains did not produce abrupt changes in the water table because the rainfall events in the mountains were damped by the distance of the recharge zone and great thickness of the unsaturated zone.},

I use cumulative data of vehicle, mobile phone, laptop, and digital camera production to show that demand will overshoot the available global Lithium resources before 2025. Even if 100\% of all Lithium-ion batteries were recycled today, recycling could not prevent this resource depletion in time. As the increasing Lithium scarcity will increase the price, it will be feasible to mine diluted resources with a strong environmental impact. I highlight these impacts in Lithium-rich Bolivia, the potential new “Saudi Arabia of Lithium.” Lithium extraction is likely to cause substantial water pollution, and—through impacts on native diversity—facilitate human health impacts from cyanobacteria that are normally kept at bay by native ﬂamingos. The strongly intertwined Lithium extraction impacts on the environment, biodiversity, and human health from evaporative ponds and ore mining need to be taken into consideration when we discuss resource protection and opportunities from Lithium recycling. Overall, sensible Lithium recycling strategies can provide effective resource and environmental protection right now but urgently need to be supplemented by alternative technologies in the near-future.},

	abstract = {The Salar de Atacama is one of the most well-known saline endorheic basins in the world. It accumulates the world main lithium reserves and contains very sensitive ecosystems. The objective of this work is to characterize the hydrodynamics of the Salar de Atacama, and to quantify its complex water balance prior to the intense brine extraction. The methodology and results can be extrapolated to the groundwater ﬂow and recharge of other salt ﬂats. A three-dimensional groundwater ﬂow model using low computational effort was calibrated against hundreds of hydraulic head measurements. The water inﬁltrated from the mountains ascends as a vertical ﬂux through the saline interface (mixing zone) produced by the density contrast between the recharged freshwater and the evaporated brine of the salt ﬂat nucleus. This water discharges and is largely evaporated from lakes or directly from the shallow water table. On the other hand, the very low hydraulic gradients, coupled with the presence of the mixing zone that operates as barrier, leads the salt ﬂat nucleus to act as a hydrodynamically quasiisolated area. The computed water table shows the lowest hydraulic head in the salt ﬂat nucleus near the discharge at the mixing zone.},

The Case 1 URR scenario indicates sufﬁcient lithium for a 77\% maximum penetration of lithium battery electric vehicles in 2080 whereas supply is adequate to beyond 2200 in the Case 3 URR scenario.

	abstract = {Abstract. The availability of highly accessible and reliable monthly gridded data sets of global land-surface precipitation is a need that was already identified in the mid-1980s when there was a complete lack of globally homogeneous gauge-based precipitation analyses. Since 1989, the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) has built up its unique capacity to assemble, quality assure, and analyse rain gauge data gathered from all over the world. The resulting database has exceeded 200 yr in temporal coverage and has acquired data from more than 85 000 stations worldwide. Based on this database, this paper provides the reference publication for the four globally gridded monthly precipitation products of the GPCC, covering a 111-yr analysis period from 1901–present. As required for a reference publication, the content of the product portfolio, as well as the underlying methodologies to process and interpolate are detailed. Moreover, we provide information on the systematic and statistical errors associated with the data products. Finally, sample applications provide potential users of GPCC data products with suitable advice on capabilities and constraints of the gridded data sets. In doing so, the capabilities to access El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) sensitive precipitation regions and to perform trend analyses across the past 110 yr are demonstrated. The four gridded products, i.e. the Climatology (CLIM) V2011, the Full Data Reanalysis (FD) V6, the Monitoring Product (MP) V4, and the First Guess Product (FG), are publicly available on easily accessible latitude/longitude grids encoded in zipped clear text ASCII files for subsequent visualization and download through the GPCC download gate hosted on ftp://ftp.dwd.de/pub/data/gpcc/html/download\_gate.html by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), Offenbach, Germany. Depending on the product, four (0.25°, 0.5°, 1.0°, 2.5° for CLIM), three (0.5°, 1.0°, 2.5°, for FD), two (1.0°, 2.5° for MP) or one (1.0° for FG) resolution is provided, and for each product a DOI reference is provided allowing for public user access to the products. A preliminary description of the scope of a fifth product – the Homogenized Precipitation Analysis (HOMPRA) – is also provided. Its comprehensive description will be submitted later in an extra paper upon completion of this data product. DOIs of the gridded data sets examined are as follows:  doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/CLIM\_M\_V2011\_025, doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/CLIM\_M\_V2011\_050, doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/CLIM\_M\_V2011\_100, doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/CLIM\_M\_V2011\_250, doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/FD\_M\_V6\_050, doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/FD\_M\_V6\_100, doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/FD\_M\_V6\_250, doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/MP\_M\_V4\_100, doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/MP\_M\_V4\_250, doi:10.5676/DWD\_GPCC/FG\_M\_100.},

	abstract = {The relationship between water and society has come to the forefront of critical inquiry in recent years, attracting signiﬁcant scholarly and popular interest. As the state hydraulic paradigm gives way to modes of water governance, there is a need to recognize, reﬂect and represent water’s broader social dimensions. In this article, we advance the concept of the hydrosocial cycle as a means of theorizing and analyzing water-society relations. The hydrosocial cycle is based on the concept of the hydrologic cycle, but modiﬁes it in important ways. While the hydrologic cycle has the effect of separating water from its social context, the hydrosocial cycle deliberately attends to water’s social and political nature. We employ a relational-dialectical approach to conceptualize the hydrosocial cycle as a socio-natural process by which water and society make and remake each other over space and time. We argue that unravelling this historical and geographical process of making and remaking offers analytical insights into the social construction and production of water, the ways by which it is made known, and the power relations that are embedded in hydrosocial change. We contend that the hydrosocial cycle comprises a process of co-constitution as well as material circulation. Existing work within the political ecology tradition considers the co-constitution of water and power, particularly in relation to processes of capital accumulation. We propose the hydrosocial cycle as an analytical tool for investigating hydrosocial relations and as a broader framework for undertaking critical political ecologies of water.},

	abstract = {Urban political ecology (UPE), an offshoot of political ecology that emerged in the late 1990s, has had two major impacts on critical urban studies: it has introduced critical political ecology to urban settings, and it has provided a framework for retheorizing the city as a product of metabolic processes of socionatural transformation. However, there was another goal in early UPE programmatic statements that has largely fallen by the wayside: to mobilize a Lefebvrian theoretical framework to trouble traditional distinctions between urban/rural and society/nature by exploring urbanization as a global process. Instead of following this potentially fruitful path, UPE has become bogged down in ‘methodological cityism’––an overwhelming analytical and empirical focus on the traditional city to the exclusion of other aspects of contemporary urbanization processes. Thus UPE's Lefebvrian promise, of a research program that could work across traditional disciplinary divisions and provide insights into a new era of planetary urbanization, has remained unfulfilled. In this article we trace UPE's history to show how it arrived at its present predicament, and offer some thoughts on a research agenda for a political ecology not of the city but of urbanization.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.03.004},
	abstract = {The dominance of “ecosystem services” as a guiding concept for environmental management – where it appears as a neutral, obvious, taken-for-granted concept – hides the fact that there are choices implicit in its framing and in its application. In other words, it is a highly political concept, and its utility depends on the arena in which it is used and what it is used for. Following a political ecology framework, and based on a literature review, bibliometric analyses, and brief examples from two tropical rainforest countries, this review investigates four moments in the construction and application of the ecosystem services idea: socio-historical (the emergence of the discourse), ontological (what knowledge does the concept allow?), scientific (difficulties in its practical application), and political (who wins, who loses?). We show how the concept is a boundary object with widespread appeal, trace the discursive and institutional context within which it gained traction, and argue that choices of scale, definition, and method in measuring ecosystem services frustrate its straightforward application. As a result, it is used in diverse ways by different interests to justify different kinds of interventions that at times might be totally opposed. In Madagascar, the ecosystem services idea is mainly used to justify forest conservation in ways open to critique for its neoliberalization of nature or disempowerment of communities. In contrast, in the Brazilian Amazon, the discourse of ecosystem services has served the agendas of traditional populations and family farm lobbies. Ecosystem services, as an idea and tool, are mobilized by diverse actors in real-life situations that lead to complex, regionally particular and fundamentally political outcomes.},

	abstract = {R\&D has always been considered a strategic asset of companies. Traditionally, companies that have their own R\&D function are better prepared to compete in the globalized economy because they are able to produce the knowledge and technology required to advance products and services. SMEs also need to become highly innovative and competitive in order to be successful. Nevertheless, their ability to have an internal R\&D function that effectively meets their innovation needs is usually very weak. Open innovation provides access to a vast amount of new ideas and technologies at lower costs than closed innovation. This paper presents an action research study being carried out at University of Minho to develop a business model and technology platform for an innovation brokering service connecting ideas and technologies being developed at Universities with the specific innovation needs of SMEs. The expected contributions of the study include the empirical investigation of the effectiveness and risks of crowdsourcing innovation when applied in the socioeconomic context of a European developing country where SMEs represent 99,6\% of the businesses.},

In particular, wikis foster collaborative, egalitarian learning that is designed to foster group interaction instead of just individual performance. Moreover, wiki based learning involves community ideals and challenging modes of interaction for both learners and instructors. The paper begins by summarising the wiki way of learning. It presents a recent study conducted in a classroom environment into how students conceptualised wiki use and uses a case study of a course in mobile workforce technologies to present the basis for a wiki pedagogy. The paper concludes with a discussion on the both the practical and theoretical implications of using wikis in a tertiary education environment.},

We show that the accretion of edits to an article is described by a simple stochastic mechanism, resulting in a heavy tail of highly visible articles with a large number of edits. We also demonstrate a crucial correlation between article quality and number of edits, which validates Wikipedia as a successful collaborative eﬀort.},

For example, data on poverty — the first of seventeen SDGs — is both spatially sparse and infrequently collected in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the high cost of surveys. Here we propose a novel method for estimating socioeconomic indicators using open-source, geolocated textual information from Wikipedia articles. We demonstrate that modern NLP techniques can be used to predict communitylevel asset wealth and education outcomes using nearby geolocated Wikipedia articles. When paired with nightlights satellite imagery, our method outperforms all previously published benchmarks for this prediction task, indicating the potential of Wikipedia to inform both research in the social sciences and future policy decisions.},

However, widespread variation exists in how labor statistics are collected in household surveys. This paper analyzes the effects of alternative survey design on employment statistics by implementing a randomized survey experiment in Tanzania. Two features of the survey design are assessed – the level of detail of the employment questions and the type of respondent. It turns out that both features have relevant and statistically significant effects on employment statistics. Using a short labor module without screening questions induces many individuals to adopt a broad definition of employment, incorrectly including domestic duties. But after reclassifying those in domestic work as ‘not working’ in order to obtain the correct ILO classification, the short module turns out to generate lower female employment rates, higher working hours for both men and women who are employed, and lower rates of wage employment than the detailed module. Response by proxy rather than self-report has no effect on female labor statistics but yields substantially lower male employment rates, mostly due to underreporting of agricultural activity. The large impacts of proxy responses on male employment rates are attenuated when proxy informants are spouses and individuals with some schooling.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and a methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates, consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover-change data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The mean ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. The variability in SOCEAN is evaluated with data products based on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic global vegetation models forced by observed climate, CO2, and land-cover-change (some including nitrogen–carbon interactions). We compare the mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to estimates from three atmospheric inverse methods for three broad latitude bands. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. For the last decade available (2004–2013), EFF was 8.9 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, ELUC 0.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, GATM 4.3 ± 0.1 GtC yr−1, SOCEAN 2.6 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, and SLAND 2.9 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1. For year 2013 alone, EFF grew to 9.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, 2.3\% above 2012, continuing the growth trend in these emissions, ELUC was 0.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, GATM was 5.4 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1, SOCEAN was 2.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 2.5 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1. GATM was high in 2013, reflecting a steady increase in EFF and smaller and opposite changes between SOCEAN and SLAND compared to the past decade (2004–2013). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 395.31 ± 0.10 ppm averaged over 2013. We estimate that EFF will increase by 2.5\% (1.3–3.5\%) to 10.1 ± 0.6 GtC in 2014 (37.0 ± 2.2 GtCO2 yr−1), 65\% above emissions in 1990, based on projections of world gross domestic product and recent changes in the carbon intensity of the global economy. From this projection of EFF and assumed constant ELUC for 2014, cumulative emissions of CO2 will reach about 545 ± 55 GtC (2000 ± 200 GtCO2) for 1870–2014, about 75\% from EFF and 25\% from ELUC. This paper documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new carbon budget compared with previous publications of this living data set (Le Quéré et al., 2013, 2014). All observations presented here can be downloaded from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (doi:10.3334/CDIAC/GCP\_2014).},

	abstract = {We present a framework for allocating a global carbon reduction target among nations, in which the concept of “common but differentiated responsibilities” refers to the emissions of individuals instead of nations. We use the income distribution of a country to estimate how its fossil fuel CO
              2
              emissions are distributed among its citizens, from which we build up a global CO
              2
              distribution. We then propose a simple rule to derive a universal cap on global individual emissions and find corresponding limits on national aggregate emissions from this cap. All of the world's high CO
              2
              -emitting individuals are treated the same, regardless of where they live. Any future global emission goal (target and time frame) can be converted into national reduction targets, which are determined by “Business as Usual” projections of national carbon emissions and in-country income distributions. For example, reducing projected global emissions in 2030 by 13 GtCO
              2
              would require the engagement of 1.13 billion high emitters, roughly equally distributed in 4 regions: the U.S., the OECD minus the U.S., China, and the non-OECD minus China. We also modify our methodology to place a floor on emissions of the world's lowest CO
              2
              emitters and demonstrate that climate mitigation and alleviation of extreme poverty are largely decoupled.},

This paper documents recent inequality trends in the Latin American region, going beyond traditional measures of income inequality. The paper also reviews some of the explanations that have been put forward to understand the current situation, and discusses why reducing income inequality should be an important policy priority. In particular, the authors discuss channels through which inequality can affect growth and output volatility. On the whole, the analysis suggests a two-pronged approach to reduce inequality in the region that combines policies aimed at improving the distribution of assets (especially education) with elements aimed at improving the capacity of the state to redistribute income through taxes and transfers.},

L’Évaluation mondiale de l’IPBES de la biodiversité et des services écosystémiques représente la production emblématique du premier programme de travail de l’IPBES (2014-2018). L’Évaluation mondiale a été lancée à la suite d’une décision prise par la plénière de l’IPBES lors de sa quatrième session (4e session de l’IPBES, Kuala Lumpur, 2016) et examinée par la plénière de l’IPBES à l’occasion de sa septième session (7e session de l’IPBES, Paris, 2019). Elle comprend un résumé à l’intention des décideurs, qui a été approuvé lors de la 7e session de l’IPBES, et six chapitres, qui ont été acceptés lors de cette même session.},

Instruments considered include emissions taxes, tradable emissions allowances, subsidies for emissions reductions, performance standards, technology mandates, and research and development subsidies. Several themes emerge. First, no single instrument is clearly superior along all the criteria. Second, significant trade-offs arise in the choice of instrument; for example, assuring a reasonable degree of distributional equity often will require a sacrifice of cost-effectiveness. Third, it is possible and sometimes desirable to design hybrid instruments that combine features of various instruments in their “pure” form. Fourth, for many pollution problems, more than one market failure may be involved, which may justify (on efficiency grounds, at least) employing more than one instrument. Finally, potential overlaps and undesirable interactions among environmental policy instruments are sometimes a matter of concern.},

Autrement dit, il mesure le niveau d'inégalité de la répartition d'une variable dans la population.
Ce coefficient est typiquement utilisé pour mesurer l'inégalité des revenus dans un pays. Il a été développé par le statisticien italien Corrado Gini. Le coefficient de Gini est un nombre variant de 0 à 1, où 0 signifie l'égalité parfaite et 1, qui ne peut être atteint, signifierait une inégalité parfaite (une seule personne dispose de tous les revenus et une infinité d’autres n'ont aucun revenu).},

	abstract = {Narrative inquiry or narrative analysis emerged as a discipline from within the broader field of qualitative research in the early 20th century, as evidence exists that this method was used in psychology and sociology. Narrative inquiry uses field texts, such as stories, autobiography, journals, field notes, letters, conversations, interviews, family stories, photos (and other artifacts), and life experience, as the units of analysis to research and understand the way people create meaning in their lives as narratives.Narrative inquiry has been employed as a tool for analysis in the fields of cognitive science, organizational studies, knowledge theory, applied linguistics, sociology, occupational science and education studies, among others. Other approaches include the development of quantitative methods and tools based on the large volume captured by fragmented anecdotal material, and that which is self signified or indexed at the point of capture. Narrative Inquiry challenges the philosophy behind quantitative/grounded data-gathering and questions the idea of “objective” data; however, it has been criticized for not being “theoretical enough." In disciplines like applied linguistics, scholarly work has pointed out that enough critical mass of studies exists in the discipline that uses this theory, and that a framework can be developed to guide its application.},

	abstract = {The world’s largest deposits of lithium lie in brines found underneath salt flats in the desert between Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Globally, lithium may reduce fossil fuel use by making batteries for cars and renewable energy storage more affordable. This article analyzes ongoing debates about lithium in these three countries to identify what hopes, fears and expectations different stakeholders are bringing to debates about lithium. My approach builds on the idea of resource imaginaries, particularly the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries that highlights the importance of science and technology to projections of desirable futures. I analyze the tensions, visions and metaphors used by different stakeholders, including activists, the media, and state and industry officials, to imagine and thus legitimate lithium extraction. This study finds three co-existing positions in these debates: lithium as a commodity, as a strategic resource or as the subject of a sociotechnical imaginary. Chile, Argentina and Bolivia are converging on the last of these, best described as a reimagining of the relationship between mining and development in which lithium, through innovation and industry, will redefine the relationship between Latin American economies and global markets. This imaginary projects a binary between raw and industrial materials and deterministically assumes that science and technology will transform the former into the latter. Disagreements and challenges notwithstanding, the article argues that this imaginary is evidence of a crisis of confidence in development that is creating space for a more dynamic debate about the social value of mining and the proper role of the state in development. This convergence will have also implications for how sustainable, equitable and reliable lithium production will be.},

Afin d’envisager l’existence de l’échelle régionale dans la géographie politique du lithium andin, notre réflexion s’inscrit autour des notions de régionalisme et de régionalisation. L’utilisation de l’expression « triangle du lithium » a-t-elle une traduction spatiale, qu’elle soit engendrée par une volonté politique ou par des pratiques plus spontanées ? À partir d’une déconstruction de la représentation mettant au jour les stratégies d’acteurs qu’elle nourrit à différentes échelles, nous analysons les processus de régionalisme inachevés et les dynamiques de régionalisation « par le bas » à l’œuvre dans cet espace transfrontalier.},

Par l’introduction de ce concept, nous souhaitons montrer que les difficultés de gestion du gouvernement sur le thème des ressources naturelles ne proviennent pas tant des incohérences du gouvernement que des dynamiques et stratégies de résistance des organisations sociales aux projets étatiques. Le principal changement qu’a connu la société bolivienne avec la victoire d’Evo Morales est ainsi le passage d’un front commun des organisations sociales contre le dénommé « néolibéralisme » à une lutte interne entre celles-ci pour le contrôle des ressources naturelles.},

Engaging with black geographies literature, I reveal how a black food justice organization grapples with violent histories of slavery and dispossession rooted in a black farming imaginary, and works to re-envision this imaginary to one of power and transformation. The spatial imaginaries and spaces of each food organization acknowledge racial histories differentially, informing their activism. Black geographies possess knowledge and spatial politics that can revitalize community food movements, and I consider how white food activists might reframe their work so that their efforts are not fueling the displacement of residents of color.},

Taking a corpus of online Press materials, with a global and multi-lingual scope, our analysis practises reading at a distance, and a geographical approach, in order to broach the spatial and temporal dimensions of the media’s highlighting of migration. The temporal variations in information flow concerning migration prove to be linked to the quantitative changes in the spatial content of the representations of the migratory situation (the geographical coverage concentrated on the EU and the Eastern Mediterranean). Due to these links, examined here with attention to the production of geographical imaginaries and to differences of scale, a global geopolitical upheaval in migration was identified.},

	abstract = {Le concept de géographie-spectacle a été formulé en 1976 par le géographe français Yves Lacoste dans son ouvrage La géographie, ça sert, d'abord, à faire la guerre qui lui permet entre autres de démontrer la fonction stratégique et politique de la géographie, et de critiquer le caractère rébarbatif de la géographie scolaire telle qu'enseignée à l'époque, sans approche polémique. Le concept fait allusion à la façon dont les médias d'information se sont emparés des éléments constitutifs de la géographie (représentations cartographiques, concepts de description de l'espace, etc.) pour en faire un message qu'il juge « inoffensif » et « qui nous place en position de passivité, de contemplation esthétique » de « belles images ». 
En ce sens, le concept est très critique d'une certaine conception de la géographie et de son enseignement, scolaire comme à l'égard du grand public, comme il est également critique du message délivré par les communicants, les mass médias, l'industrie du tourisme. Dans l'édition augmentée de l'ouvrage, en 2012, Yves Lacoste nuance son propos sur la géographie telle que présentée par les médias, en reconnaissant l'importance des représentations de paysages dans l'apprentissage de la géographie, tout en maintenant son reproche fait au tout-image.
Contrairement à la géographie sociale, à la géographie économique, à la géographie politique ou encore à la géographie rurale, et à l'instar d'autres concepts avancés dans l'ouvrage d'Yves Lacoste, la « géographie-spectacle » n'est pas un champ d'études géographique ni même forcément un choix délibéré mais davantage un concept critique, formulé par des scientifiques à l'égard d'un constat, d'une situation donnée qui associe des éléments de géographie à des thématiques, disciplines ou enjeux a priori externes (message touristique et commercial par exemple) par le biais de supports de communication (publicité, œuvre artistique, discours).},

	abstract = {"Qu'est-ce que la "crise des migrants" en Europe ? Cette expression simple, parée des attributs de l'évidence, s'est imposée dans le débat public depuis 2015. Parfois également nommée "crise des réfugiés", elle fait référence à l'augmentation récente et massive des entrées en Europe de populations en provenance notamment de pays déstabilisés, voire en guerre: Syrie, Afghanistan, Érythrée, etc. L'objectif de cet ouvrage est de fournir des clés de compréhension en prenant de la distance par rapport aux représentations communes du phénomène. Pour éclairer l'actualité des mouvements migratoires vers l'Europe, il prend le parti de ne pas traiter seulement des évènements récents et d'élargir le champ géographique au-delà des frontières du Vieux Continent. Dépasser les discours sensationnalistes des médias, qui fondent les peurs de l'invasion et les fantasmes du repli sur soi, nécessite en effet de décentrer le regard. Le décentrement par les chiffres contribue à prendre la mesure des faits migratoires tels qu'ils sont: sans en masquer l'importance, mais en en précisant l'ampleur et les caractéristiques. Le décentrement historique, ensuite, permet à propos de la crise actuelle de dépasser l'illusion du "jamais vu" sans tomber dans celle du "toujours ainsi". Enfin, le décentrement géographique remet en cause une représentation des migrations internationales qui seraient réduites à des flux orientés des pays "pauvres" vers les pays "riches"."--Page 4 of cover},

	abstract = {Temporal and spatial shifts in media narratives on dams (1945-2014).—This article lays the groundwork for a study on the evolution of discourse about a topical object, the dam. The dam is used here as an indicator to examine how the environment is portrayed. Our research uses the French national daily newspaper, Le Monde, (1945-2014) to develop a francocentered, geo-history of the public perception of dams. Content analysis and textometry are applied to the study of narratives on dams. The periodization of media discourse reveals two temporal shifts (the 1970’s and 1982). Hypotheses on the geographic nuances in the mediatization of large dams are posited. Our research is also based on archives and oral narratives, allowing for a comparison of media versus stakeholders' discourse at key moments when attitudes concerning dams shifted.},

	abstract = {The concept of „neoliberalism‟ has, during the past twenty years or so, become quite widespread in some political and academic debates. Several authors have even suggested that neoliberalism is „the dominant ideology shaping our world today‟, and that we live in an „age of neoliberalism‟. The overshadowing importance accorded by some to the phenomenon of neoliberalism does not signify, however, that it is a clearly defined concept. We suggest in this article that while the concept itself has become an imprecise exhortation in much of the literature, often describing any tendency deemed to be undesirable, it might still be given a more precise definition, which we attempt below. If this is done, then the concept could become a useful analytical device in order to describe some recent economic and political trends, even if it is an ever so slight overstatement to say that we live in a neoliberal age or a neoliberal society.},

	abstract = {When India became independent in 1947 after two centuries of colonial rule, it immediately adopted a firmly democratic political system, with multiple parties, freedom of speech, and extensive political rights. The famines of the British era disappeared, and steady economic growth replaced the economic stagnation of the Raj. The growth of the Indian economy quickened further over the last three decades and became the second fastest among large economies. Despite a recent dip, it is still one of the highest in the world. Maintaining rapid as well as environmentally sustainable growth remains an important and achievable goal for India. In An Uncertain Glory , two of India's leading economists argue that the country's main problems lie in the lack of attention paid to the essential needs of the people, especially of the poor, and often of women. There have been major failures both to foster participatory growth and to make good use of the public resources generated by economic growth to enhance people's living conditions. There is also a continued inadequacy of social services such as schooling and medical care as well as of physical services such as safe water, electricity, drainage, transportation, and sanitation. In the long run, even the feasibility of high economic growth is threatened by the underdevelopment of social and physical infrastructure and the neglect of human capabilities, in contrast with the Asian approach of simultaneous pursuit of economic growth and human development, as pioneered by Japan, South Korea, and China. In a democratic system, which India has great reason to value, addressing these failures requires not only significant policy rethinking by the government, but also a clearer public understanding of the abysmal extent of social and economic deprivations in the country. The deep inequalities in Indian society tend to constrict public discussion, confining it largely to the lives and concerns of the relatively affluent. Drèze and Sen present a powerful analysis of these deprivations and inequalities as well as the possibility of change through democratic practice.},

	abstract = {A “poverty trap” can be understood as a set of self-reinforcing mechanisms whereby countries start poor and remain poor: poverty begets poverty, so that current poverty is itself a direct cause of poverty in the future. The idea of a poverty trap has this striking implication for policy: much poverty is needless, in the sense that a different equilibrium is possible and one-time policy efforts to break the poverty trap may have lasting effects. But what does the modern evidence suggest about the extent to which poverty traps exist in practice and the underlying mechanisms that may be involved? The main mechanisms we examine include S-shaped savings functions at the country level; “big-push” theories of development based on coordination failures; hunger-based traps which rely on physical work capacity rising nonlinearly with food intake at low levels; and occupational poverty traps whereby poor individuals who start businesses that are too small will be trapped earning subsistence returns. We conclude that these types of poverty traps are rare and largely limited to remote or otherwise disadvantaged areas. We discuss behavioral poverty traps as a recent area of research, and geographic poverty traps as the most likely form of a trap. The resulting policy prescriptions are quite different from the calls for a big push in aid or an expansion of microfinance. The more-likely poverty traps call for action in less-traditional policy areas such as promoting more migration.},

It is often assumed that integration in receiving countries and the concomitant weakening of transnational ties decreases the likelihood of returning. However, according to alternative theoretical interpretations, return migration can also be the outflow of successful integration in receiving countries. Drawing on a data set of four African immigrant groups in Spain and Italy, this articlereviews these conflicting hypotheses by assessing the effects of integration and transnational ties on return migration intentions. The results of the analysis suggest that socio-cultural integration has a negative effect on return migration intentions, while economic integration and transnational ties have more ambiguous and sometimes positive effects. The results provide mixed support for the different hypotheses but question theoretical perspectives that unequivocally conceptualizereturn migration and transnationalism as causes and/or consequences of "integration failure".},

To measure major social change in space, this paper proposes an approach combining smoothing and discriminant analysis. The data used (socio-professional categories from INSEE’s censuses of 1990 and 1999 at the level of each IRIS district) show that the two socially opposed spaces are extremely compact and are becoming even more so as small existing centres merge. Mapping also shows a clear trend towards a reinforcement and linearisation of the discontinuities surrounding the more disadvantaged spaces. Conversely, the discontinuities observed around the edges of the most advantaged spaces followed various patterns between 1990 and 1999.},

	abstract = {In the late 50's and early 60\% the Inuit people of Canada settled down in permanent villages under various pressures. One of the major changes related to this move to the settled way of life was the shift from igloos — and summer tents — to permanent houses, at first very simple one-room units called "match-box houses" and later multiple-bedroom ones. Houses are a powerful expression of cultural values. Identity is first nurtered inside of them, and one learns there the basic spatial rules of his community. Therefore, one can expect exposure to an architecture carrying values of an alien culture to have important impacts on its dwellers. Yet so far, both geographers and Arctic anthropologists have neglected domestic spaces issues, the former not feeling at ease with the micro-scale and the later focusing their attention on the newly formed communities, at the settlement scale. This paper discusses the results of a study conducted among the Inuinnait people (Western Central Arctic) about the way they have been dealing, for over 30 years now, with the shift from vernacular dwellings to social housing ones. Information was collected through both observation over nearly 15 years (19862000) of Inuit's modem homes and their spatial organization, and formal semi-directive interviews conducted with elderly women — who experienced the shift as mothers — in the spring of 1998. The research revealed that adaptation has been more than difficult, but also that, if the Inuit culture is put at risk in the new dwellings, it is inside of them too that the Inuit are creating mediations between their culture in transition and the Western one. Building from this case study, the conclusion insists on the importance of domestic spaces as geographical spaces through which we can get a better understanding of the dynamics of cultures and identifies.},

	abstract = {Elinor Ostrom, née le 7 août 1933 à Los Angeles (Californie) et morte le 12 juin 2012 à Bloomington (Indiana), est une politologue et économiste américaine. En octobre 2009, elle est la première femme à recevoir le prix dit Nobel d'économie, avec Oliver Williamson, « pour son analyse de la gouvernance économique, et en particulier, des biens communs »,.
Ses travaux portent principalement sur la théorie de l'action collective et la gestion des biens communs ainsi que des biens publics, aussi bien matériels qu'immatériels. Ils s'inscrivent dans le cadre de la nouvelle économie institutionnelle. Elinor Ostrom a surtout travaillé sur la notion de dilemme social, c'est-à-dire les cas où la quête de l'intérêt personnel conduit à un résultat plus mauvais pour tous que celui résultant d'un autre type de comportement. Elle a surtout étudié la question du dilemme social dans le domaine des ressources communes : ressources hydrauliques, forêts, pêcheries, etc. Avant ses travaux, dans ces cas, seulement deux solutions étaient envisagées : l'État-Léviathan, qui impose le bien public, ou alors une définition stricte des droits de propriété individuelle. L'œuvre d'Ostrom tend à montrer qu'il existe un autre type de solutions, l'autogouvernement, dont elle définit les huit principes caractéristiques nécessaires à sa pérennité, ainsi que les deux éléments clés de son émergence : la réciprocité et la confiance.
Pour analyser les dilemmes sociaux, Ostrom met au point un cadre d'analyse, l'IAD (Institutional Analysis and Development), qui est rapidement recommandé par les institutions internationales. L'IAD repose sur la prise en compte des caractéristiques du monde physique environnant, sur celles de la communauté en proie au problème, sur les règles et normes en vigueur dans le champ de la situation d'action, ainsi que sur les interactions entre les acteurs. Les notions de normes, de règles et de droit occupent une place centrale dans sa pensée. Les normes sont des attributs de la communauté, les règles, au contraire, sont fixées de façon beaucoup plus consciente pour résoudre un dilemme social et servent de cadre à l'établissement de droits. Ostrom reprend la conception du droit de propriété en termes de faisceau de droits de John Rogers Commons et du réalisme juridique américain. D'une manière générale, Elinor et son époux Vincent Ostrom ont une vision décentralisée de la prise de décision qui remonte à leurs premières études sur les ressources en eaux et sur la gestion des aires urbaines : à la vision centralisée qui s'impose dans les années 1960 aux États-Unis, ils opposent une vision plus polycentrée — la polycentricité est un autre de leurs concepts-clés — avec interaction de multiples autorités non strictement hiérarchisées.
Les travaux d'Elinor Ostrom sont peu critiqués de son vivant. En effet, en soutenant  — comme Herbert Simon — que la rationalité des individus est limitée et en refusant de penser que la maximisation de l'utilité est la seule forme de comportement rationnel, elle s'attire les sympathies des opposants au courant strictement néo-classique de l'économie. Par ailleurs, son refus de s'en remettre nécessairement à l'État dans les cas de dilemmes sociaux, la fait apprécier des disciples de Friedrich Hayek. Après son décès, toutefois, les travaux d'Ostrom commencent à être critiqués à la fois par les partisans de solutions par l'État, qui l'accusent de ne pas bien prendre en considération les problèmes politiques, et par ceux qui l'accusent de ne pas avoir bien compris la notion de droit de propriété.},

	abstract = {Since the mid-1990s, researchers have used micro datasets to study countries' production and trade at the firm level and have found that exporting firms differ substantially from firms that solely serve the domestic market. Across a wide range of countries and industries, exporting firms have been shown to be larger, more productive, more skill- and capital-intensive, and to pay higher wages than nonexporting firms. These differences exist even before exporting begins and have important consequences for evaluating the gains from trade and their distribution across factors of production. The new empirical research challenges traditional models of international trade and, as a result, the focus of the international trade field has shifted from countries and industries towards firms and products. Recently available transaction-level U.S. trade data reveal new stylized facts about firms' participation in international markets, and recent theories of international trade incorporating the behavior of heterogenous firms have made substantial progress in explaining patterns of trade and productivity growth.},

Les autres, la Chine et l'Asie du Sud-Est, n'ont commencé leur processus de rattrapage que depuis les années cinquante, et n'ont accéléré leur croissance que depuis les années quatre-vingts. Quel est le moteur de ce développement exceptionnel dans l'histoire économique mondiale ? En apportant une réponse claire, les auteurs ne négligent cependant aucun aspect du phénomène : les racines historiques et culturelles, la mécanique économique tant interne qu'externe, sans oublier de présenter les acteurs souvent inconnus, en Occident, du " miracle ", c'est-à-dire les grandes entreprises asiatiques. A travers leur histoire se révèlent les mille et une voies de la réussite.

	abstract = {I conducted a data update to Limits to Growth (LtG), best known from the 1972 bestseller that forecasted a scenario of global societal collapse occurring around the present time if humanity did not alter its priorities. Empirical data comparisons since then indicated that the world was still heading for collapse. My objectives were to examine whether this was still the case based on the most recent data, and whether there was opportunity left to change that trajectory. My research benefited from improved data availability, and included a scenario and two variables that had not been part of previous comparisons. I collected data from academia, (non)government agencies, United Nations entities, and the World Bank. This was plotted along four LtG scenarios spanning a range of technological, resource, and societal assumptions. From these graphs and two quantitative accuracy measures, I found that the scenarios aligned closely with observed global data, which is a testament to the LtG work done decades ago. The two scenarios aligning most closely indicate a halt in growth over the next decade or so, which puts into question the usability of continuous growth as humanity’s goal in the 21st century. Both scenarios also indicate subsequent declines, but only one—the scenario in which declines are caused by pollution, including greenhouse gas pollution—depicts a collapse pattern. The scenario with the smallest declines aligned least with empirical data, however, absolute differences were rarely big and sometimes insignificant. This suggests that it’s almost, but not yet, too late for society to change course.},

Led by China and India, the share of developing economies in global exports more than doubled between 1994 and 2008. One feature of new trade patterns is greater South-South trade. China and India have booming demand for imported raw materials, which they use to build cities and factories. Industrialization throughout the South has deepened global production networks, contributing to greater trade in intermediate inputs. A second feature of new trade patterns is the return of comparative advantage as a driver of global commerce. Growth in low- and middle-income nations makes specialization according to comparative advantage more important for the global composition of trade, as North-South and South-South commerce overtakes North-North flows. China's export specialization evolves rapidly over time, revealing a capacity to speed up product ladders. Most developing countries hyper-specialize in a handful of export products. The emergence of low- and middle-income countries in trade reveals significant gaps in knowledge about the deep empirical determinants of export specialization, the dynamics of specialization patterns, and why South-South and North-North trade differ.},

	abstract = {David Rolfe Graeber (; February 12, 1961 – September 2, 2020) was an American anthropologist and anarchist activist. His influential work in economic anthropology, particularly his books Debt: The First 5,000 Years (2011) and Bullshit Jobs (2018), and his leading role in the Occupy movement, earned him recognition as one of the foremost anthropologists and left-wing thinkers of his time.Born in New York to a working-class Jewish family, Graeber studied at Purchase College and the University of Chicago, where he conducted ethnographic research in Madagascar under Marshall Sahlins and obtained his doctorate in 1996. He was an assistant professor at Yale University from 1998 to 2005, when the university controversially decided not to renew his contract before he was eligible for tenure. Unable to secure another position in the United States, he entered an "academic exile" in England, where he was a lecturer and reader at Goldsmiths' College from 2008 to 2013, and a professor at the London School of Economics from 2013.
In his early scholarship, Graeber specialized in theories of value (Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value, 2002), social hierarchy and political power (Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology, 2004, Possibilities, 2007, On Kings, 2017), and the ethnography of Madagascar (Lost People, 2007). In the 2010s he turned to historical anthropology, producing his best-known book, Debt: The First 5000 Years (2011), an exploration of the historical relationship between debt and social institutions, as well as a series of essays on the origins of social inequality in prehistory. In parallel, he developed critiques of bureaucracy and managerialism in contemporary capitalism, published in The Utopia of Rules (2015) and Bullshit Jobs (2018). He coined the concept of bullshit jobs in a 2013 essay that explored the proliferation of "paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence".Although exposed to radical left politics from a young age, Graeber's direct involvement in activism began with the global justice movement of the 1990s. He attended protests against the 3rd Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in 2001 and the World Economic Forum in New York in 2002, and later wrote an ethnography of the movement, Direct Action (2009). In 2011, he became well known as one of the leading figures of Occupy Wall Street and is credited with coining the slogan "We are the 99\%". His later activism included interventions in support of the Rojava revolution in Syria, the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn and Extinction Rebellion.
Graeber was married to artist Nika Dubrovsky. Together, they initiated the so-called Museum of Care, a shared space for communication and social interactions nourishing values of solidarity, care, and reciprocity. According to David Graeber website, “The main goal of the Museum of Care is to produce and maintain social relationships.”  The concept “museum of care” was coined by Graeber and Dubrovsky in their article “The Museum of Care: imagining the world after the pandemic”, originally published in “Arts Of The Working Class” in April 2020.  In the article, Graeber and Dubrovsky imagine a post-pandemic future, where vast surfaces of office spaces and conservative institutions are turned into “free city universities, social centers and hotels for those in need of shelter”. “We could call them ‘Museums of Care' - precisely because they are spaces that do not celebrate production of any sort but rather provide the space and means for the creation of social relationships and the imagining of entirely new forms of social relations.” David Graeber died unexpectedly in September 2020, while on vacation in Venice. His last book, The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity, co-written with archaeologist David Wengrow, was published posthumously in 2021.},

	abstract = {David Ricardo (1817) provided a mathematical example showing that countries could gain from trade by exploiting innate differences in their ability to make different goods. In the basic Ricardian example, two countries do better by specializing in different goods and exchanging them for each other, even when one country is better at making both. This example typically gets presented in the first or second chapter of a text on international trade, and sometimes appears even in a principles text. But having served its pedagogical purpose, the model is rarely heard from again. The Ricardian model became something like a family heirloom, brought down from the attic to show a new generation of students, and then put back. Nearly two centuries later, however, the Ricardian framework has experienced a revival. Much work in international trade during the last decade has returned to the assumption that countries gain from trade because they have access to different technologies. These technologies may be generally available to producers in a country, as in the Ricardian model of trade, our topic here, or exclusive to individual firms. This line of thought has brought Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage back to center stage. Our goal is to make this new old trade theory accessible and to put it to work on some current issues in the international economy.},

	abstract = {Bruno Latour est un sociologue, anthropologue et philosophe des sciences français né le 22 juin 1947 à Beaune.
Après avoir été assistant de Jean-Jacques Salomon au CNAM, puis avoir enseigné à l'École des mines de Paris, de 1982 à 2006, il est depuis septembre 2006 professeur à l'Institut d'études politiques de Paris. En septembre 2007, il devient directeur scientifique et directeur adjoint de Sciences-Po. En 2009, il participe à la création du médialab. En 2010, il initie, au sein de Sciences-Po, le programme d'expérimentation en arts et politique (SPEAP).
Connu pour ses travaux en sociologie des sciences, il a mené des enquêtes de terrain où il observe des scientifiques au travail et décrit le processus de recherche scientifique d'abord comme une construction sociale. Il a également mis en cause l'exclusivité des matériaux « sociaux » dans la « construction » des faits scientifiques, abandonnant le constructivisme social pour une théorie plus large de l'acteur-réseau. En 2007, Bruno Latour est classé parmi les dix chercheurs les plus cités en sciences humaines. Il jouit d'une certaine notoriété dans le monde académique anglophone, où une journaliste l'a une fois décrit comme « le plus célèbre et le plus incompris des philosophes français ».
Ses ouvrages les plus connus sont La Vie de laboratoire (1979), La Science en action (1987), Nous n'avons jamais été modernes (1991) et Politiques de la nature (1999). Parmi ses principales influences, on peut mentionner William James, Ludwik Fleck, Alfred North Whitehead, Michel Serres, Harold Garfinkel (ethnométhodologie), David Bloor, Gilles Deleuze, Gabriel Tarde, Isabelle Stengers… Bruno Latour est membre du comité d'orientation de la revue Cosmopolitiques.},

	abstract = {En philosophie, l’ontologie est « la science de ce qui est, des types et structures des objets, propriétés, évènements, processus et relations »; En informatique et management des connaissances, une « ontologie » est la spécification de la conceptualisation d’un domaine de connaissance. Pour la simulation multi-agents, le domaine concerne les modèles et non les « données ». Pour répondre à la question « Pourquoi un cadre ontologique pour la modélisation multi-agents en sciences humaines et sociales? », cet article aborde d’abord trois dimensions: (1) ingénierie des modèles (2) aspects thématiques (disciplinaires) et épistémologiques (3) comparaison et évaluation de modèle (test ontologique). À la différence de nombreuses ontologies, cet article ne propose pas une unique représentation d’un domaine de connaissance, mais le maintien d’une possible pluralité, basée sur le concept de « cadre de connaissance », conçu pour permettre d’intégrer une pluralité de « point de vue » dans un cadre général qui nous permet de comparer et/ou combiner différents points de vue qui coexistent en sciences sociales. La dernière partie présente ainsi quelques exemples de points de vue ontologiques qui peuvent être dérivés à partir du modèle de ségrégation résidentielle introduit par Schelling.
          , 
            From Philosophy, ontology is “the science of what is, of the kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes and relations”. In computer sciences and knowledge management an “ontology” is a specification of a conceptualization of a given knowledge domain. For multi-agent simulation, the domain is models rather than data. To answer the question “Why an ontological framework for the multi-agent modelling in the Social Sciences?”, this paper deals first with three dimensions: (1) model engineering, (2) thematical and epistemological issues and (3) model assessment and comparisons (ontological test). Contrary to several ontologies, this paper does not propose a single representation of the knowledge domain, but a possible plurality, based on the concept of “knowledge framework” building to integrate the plurality of “point of view” co-existing in the Social Sciences within a general framework. Accordingly, the last part presents some examples of ontological points of view on a model of residential segregation derived from the Schelling’s one.},

The movement is also commonly referred to as the global justice movement, alter-globalization movement, anti-globalist movement, anti-corporate globalization movement, or movement against neoliberal globalization. There are many definitions of anti-globalization.Participants base their criticisms on a number of related ideas.  What is shared is that participants oppose large, multinational corporations having unregulated political power, exercised through trade agreements and deregulated financial markets. Specifically, corporations are accused of seeking to maximize profit at the expense of work safety conditions and standards, labour hiring and compensation standards, environmental conservation principles, and the integrity of national legislative authority, independence and sovereignty. As of January 2012, some commentators have characterized changes in the global economy as "turbo-capitalism" (Edward Luttwak), "market fundamentalism" (George Soros), "casino capitalism" (Susan Strange), and as "McWorld" (Benjamin Barber).},

	abstract = {The 1988 annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank were met with an international protest in West Berlin. Whereas the organizations' earlier meetings were met with smaller, national protests, the 1988 meetings attracted protesters internationally against what was the largest assembly of the international monetary order since the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. Protesters demonstrated against the IMF's austerity policies towards developing nations. Representatives from Third World countries called for debt cancellation, and others advocated for solutions to world hunger and poverty. Due to the protest's high-profile venue, media outlets extensively covered the protests. Later IMF and World Bank meetings received smaller protests, but following the 1999 Seattle WTO protests, all meetings of the IMF, World Bank, G7, and G8 summits were met with significant protests.},

	abstract = {Le concept de développement désigne l’ensemble des transformations techniques, sociales, territoriales, démographiques et culturelles accompagnant la croissance de la production. Il traduit l’aspect structurel et qualitatif de la croissance et peut être associé à l’idée de progrès économique et social.
 Après avoir privilégié la seule croissance de la production de richesses par des indicateurs comme le PIB, le concept de développement s'est élargi pour inclure différentes dimensions constitutives du bien-être, voire du bonheur : l'état global de santé des populations, les niveaux d'instruction, d'une manière générale, les conditions de vie.
 La réflexion sur les indicateurs pertinents pour mesurer le développement prend de plus en plus en compte la dimension du bien-être (et/ou du bonheur) et il y a profusion d'indicateurs économiques, sociaux et environnementaux qui tentent de l'évaluer, le mesurer.

Développement en Afrique Le développement économique et social a partie étroitement liée avec la pacification et l'atténuation des conflits, en Afrique ou ailleurs dans le monde. Parmi les 10 pays en bas de tableau de l'IDH en 2004, neuf ont connu un conflit violent depuis les années 1990.
 Le développement peut être mû par des mécanismes endogènes. Mais, dans le cas des pays d'Afrique subsaharienne les plus démunis, divers mécanismes d'aide internationale paraissent indispensables.
 L'Onu avait défini en 2000, des Objectifs du millénaire pour le développement (OMD)* visant à réduire l'extrême pauvreté d'ici à 2015. De nombreux États africains sont concernés. Les fonds nécessaires à leur mise en œuvre doivent être rassemblés pour 2010, l'Aide publique au développement (APD) devrait alors atteindre 130 milliards d'USD (contre 80 en 2004), soit 50 milliards supplémentaires, dont la moitié destinéeà l'Afrique. Mais, selon les derniers engagements pris par les pays développés du G8, il n'est pas précisé si les mesures d'annulation de la dette feront partie de ces montants.
 Des mécanismes de taxation redistributive ont également été proposés. Par exemple, le Trésor britannique espère lever 4 milliards d'USD d'ici à 2015 par le biais d'un système de "Facilité financière internationale". Les Français, suivis par les Chiliens et les Britanniques, ont proposé une taxe sur les billets d'avion qui devrait être effective en France pour la mi-2006.
 Mais l'aide au développement ne se résume pas aux différentes formes d'aide publique. Les règles des échanges mondiaux définies dans le cadre de l'OMC, ou dans des cadres bilatéraux, peuvent inciter ou, au contraire, freiner, le développement économique des pays les plus pauvres. Les financements privés, par le biais de fondations d'entreprise par exemple, jouent aussi leur rôle (par exemple, la fondation Bill et Melinda Gates, dotée de 30 milliards de dollars, investit beaucoup dans le domaine de la santé et de la lutte contre le sida). Le bilan global est donc délicat à faire.
 À moins de 10 ans de l'échéance de 2015, les OMD des pays d'Afrique subsaharienne paraissent souvent loin d'être acquis : 42 des 47 pays concernés ne pourront pas atteindre la moitié d'entre eux et 12 pays ne devraient en atteindre aucun. Au demeurant, la définition de ces objectifs a mobilisé la coopération internationale contre la pauvreté en la dotant d'un contrat collectif et d'un calendrier, premier exemple d'une planification de développement à l'échelle mondiale. La gestion de l'aide a été recentrée sur la recherche de résultats plutôt que sur le suivi des moyens mis en œuvre. Des cercles vertueux d'un développement durable en Afrique pourraient en être favorisés.
 La réflexion sur les conditions du développement en Afrique passe aussi par l'examen du couple développement x gouvernance. Comment fonctionne leur corrélation ? Une bonne gouvernance est-elle la condition d'un développement vertueux ou l'inverse ?
 La Banque mondiale, dans son dernier rapport sur la "gouvernance mondiale" (2005), a passé en revue 209 pays en fonction de 352 critères provenant de la Banque mondiale elle-même mais aussi de la fondation Freedom House ou du cabinet d'audit PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Son constat est le suivant : l'amélioration des conditions de vie est le résultat d'une meilleure gouvernance et non l'inverse. C'est donc la démocratie qui prime, pas l'économie, du moins pour une majorité de pays car il peut y avoir des exceptions (la Chine ou les pétro-monarchies du Golfe, par exemple, dont les caractéristiques sont à bien des égards particulières). D'une manière générale, une bonne gouvernance, à savoir une redistribution équitable des richesses et des ressources, des transferts raisonnés en faveur de l'éducation, de la santé, débouche sur des conditions de vie meilleures et sur une réduction renforcée de la pauvreté. Les effets sont rapidement efficaces : l'amélioration des droits humains, l'efficacité de l'administration et des régulations publiques, la lutte contre la corruption, le respect de règles de droit ont, d'après le rapport de la Banque mondiale, des résultats en moins de 10 ans.

 Sur le même thème, voir le glossaire Afrique subsaharienne : territoires et conflits  Développement en Chine De 1980 à 2005, le taux de croissance annuel moyen du PIB de la RPC a été d'environ 8\%. La Chine, par son PIB de 7 430 milliards d'USD (en parité de pouvoir d'achat), est devenue la cinquième économie mondiale en 2004, après les États-Unis, le Japon, l'Allemagne, le Royaume-Uni et la France. Et si elle ne pèse encore que 5\% dans le PIB mondial, très inférieur au poids de sa population, elle contribue pour 20\% à la croissance mondiale (données 2006). Ces chiffres sont à prendre avec précaution et il faut tenir compte de l'importante économie parallèle qui échappe aux statistiques, soit environ 20\% d'économie "non-fiscalisée". Certains économistes pensent donc qu'ils sont sous-évalués et que les taux officiels seraient volontairement minorés pour limiter la méfiance et les accusations de surchauffe des partenaires commerciaux de la Chine.
 Cette croissance rapide s'explique par un "effet de rattrapage" et elle partage plusieurs points communs avec d'autres "miracles" de la zone Asie-Pacifique (Japon, Corée du Sud, Taiwan, Singapour) : une stratégie de développement industriel volontariste et fondée sur l'ouverture libérale et la conquête des marchés extérieurs, une population travailleuse et économe dont l'épargne finance en partie le développement. Mais la croissance économique chinoise a ses spécificités : c'est avant tout une économie de flux dont l'évolution repose sur une très rapide privatisation et sur la restructuration du secteur étatique.
 Un tel rythme de croissance, concernant une population aussi importante, n'est pas sans conséquences : pression sur les ressources (énergie, matières premières) tant à l'échelle régionale que mondiale, dégâts environnementaux, risques de surchauffe, risques d'amplification des disparités. Les goulets d'étranglement traditionnels de l'économie chinoise s'aggravent ainsi qu'en attestent les pénuries énergétiques (fréquentes coupures d'électricité), les engorgements des infrastructures de transport. En l'absence de correctifs adaptés, les tensions induites pourraient provoquer un ralentissement de la croissance chinoise à plus ou moins court terme.
 La compétitivité de l'économie chinoise a des composantes contrastées : si elle a un faible coût du travail, elle souffre de facteurs moins favorables en termes de gouvernance, de qualité des infrastructures, de gestion environnementale. Les autorités chinoises mettent, depuis 2003, officiellement du moins, l'accent sur la "qualité de la croissance" et les "respect des grands équilibres", dans les campagnes par exemple. Parallèlement, des efforts importants sont réalisés pour compenser le retard chinois en Recherche \& développement : le développement scientifique et technologique est prioritaire dans le cadre du XIe plan quinquennal (2006-2010). La Chine recrute ses meilleurs chercheurs au même niveau de rémunération qu'aux États-Unis et bénéficie du retour d'une diaspora de scientifiques formés dans les laboratoires occidentaux, principalement anglo-saxons ("reverse brain drain"). En 2003, la Chine occupait le cinquième rang mondial pour la production scientifique derrière les États-Unis, le Japon, le Royaume-Uni et l'Allemagne avec 5,1\% des publications internationales. Et elle cherche à s'affranchir de sa dépendance à l'égard des brevets étrangers en concevant de nouveaux produits, avec de nouveaux standards, basés sur des brevets chinois.

 Développement en Russie La croissance du PIB russe est soutenue : selon le FMI, elle devrait atteindre 6\% du PIB en 2004 (7,3\% en 2003 et 4,7\% en 2002). De 1998 à 2003, le PIB a augmenté en Russie de 25\%, les investissements de 35\% et la production agricole de 20\%. Cette croissance est largement tirée par l'effet des recettes d'exportation, résultat du renchérissement des prix des hydrocarbures et de l'ensemble des matières premières sur les marchés mondiaux. Les secteurs pétrolier et gazier contribuent à environ 12\% du PIB et 1/5e de la croissance serait exclusivement due à la hausse des cours du pétrole (données 2003). Cette rente a également permis de ramener la dette publique à 33\% du PIB (contre plus de 98\% en 1998). Notons aussi qu'une part non négligeable de l'économie russe relève du secteur informel, échappant donc tout à la fois aux statistiques et à l'impôt.
 
 Mais la croissance n'est pas le développement. La dynamique d'un réel développement de la Russie n'est pas encore enclenchée. Si l'on se reporte à l'indicateur de développement humain (IDH), qui donne une mesure plus globale du niveau de bien-être, le recul de la Russie est notable : elle occupait le 34e rang en 1991, mais le 71e en 1997, se situant alors derrière la Belarus, pour revenir au 57e en 2003 (0,795).
 L'économie russe n'a pas encore acquis une dynamique propre combinant production et consommation domestiques. L'exploitation de la rente énergétique place l'État dans une situation de dépendance et de vulnérabilité aux variations des cours des matières premières, d'autant plus que les recettes fiscales tirées de la vente de ces ressources alimentent en grande partie le budget fédéral. Drainant l'essentiel des investissements (75\%), le secteur énergétique tend à brider le développement des autres secteurs d'activité (ce que les économistes appellent le "syndrome hollandais"). L'économie domestique n'est, de ce fait, pas en mesure de répondre à la demande intérieure, en particulier en matière de biens de consommation courante, ce qui favorise les importations.

	abstract = {China has emerged as an economic powerhouse (projected to have the largest economy in the world in a little over a decade) and is taking an ever-increasing role on the world stage. China's Rise: Challenges and Opportunities will help the United States and the rest of the world better comprehend the facts and dynamics underpinning China's rise--an understanding that becomes more and more important with each passing day. Additionally, the authors suggest actions both China and the United States can take that will not only maximize the opportunities for China's constructive integration into the international community but also help form a domestic consensus that will provide a stable foundation for such policies. Filled with facts for policymakers, this much anticipated book's narrative-driven, accessible style will appeal to the general reader. This book is unique in that it analyzes the authoritative data on China's economy, foreign and domestic policy, and national security. The expert judgments in this book paint a picture of a China confronting domestic challenges that are in many ways side effects of its economic successes, while simultaneously trying to take advantage of the foreign policy benefits of those same successes. China's Rise: Challenges and Opportunities from The China Balance Sheet Project, a joint, multiyear project of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Peterson Institute, discusses China's military modernization, China's increasing soft power influence in Asia and around the world, China's policy toward Taiwan, domestic political development, Beijing's political relations with China's provincial and municipal authorities, corruption and social unrest, rebalancing China's economic growth, the exchange rate controversy, energy and the environment, industrial policy, trade disputes, and investment issues.

	abstract = {Economic integration creates two different forces on industrial location: dispersion and agglomeration forces. The dispersion force relocates industries across integrated countries according to each country’s comparative advantage and achieves the static efficiency of resource allocation. In contrast, the agglomeration force serves as a dynamic source of industrialization but at the same time, it may produce the economic disparities among integrated countries and among domestic regions within each country. In order to work out effective development strategies under the influence of the two forces, it is important to manage dexterously the nonlinear effects, such as home market effect, lock-in effect and hub effect. With these effects, drastic progress in long-term economic development can be triggered by a single success of a short-term program for inviting firms, particularly in the initial stage of agglomeration. Individual policies therefore bear great importance in the industrialization process, but the government of each country is likely to face two kinds of difficulties in developing a successful strategy: (1) strategy-building requires extremely accurate information about the state of the country; and (2) difficulty in policy coordination to avoid excess public investment for development.},

	abstract = {Background: Ambulance response time is typically reported as the time interval from call dispatch to arrival on-scene. However, the often unmeasured “vertical response time” from arrival on-scene to arrival at the patient's side may be substantial, particularly in urban areas with high-rise buildings or other barriers to access. Objectives: To measure the time interval from arrival on-scene to the patient in a large metropolitan area and to identify barriers to emergency medical services arrival. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of response times for high-priority call types in the New York City 9-1-1 emergency medical services system. Research assistants riding with paramedics enrolled a convenience sample of calls between 2001 and 2003. Results: A total of 449 paramedic calls were included, with a median time from call dispatch to arrival on-scene of 5.2 minutes. The median on-scene to patient arrival interval was 2.1 minutes, leading to an actual response interval (dispatch to patient) of 7.6 minutes. The median on-scene to patient interval was 2.8 minutes for residential buildings, 2.7 minutes for office complexes, 1.3 minutes for private homes (less than four stories), and 0.5 minutes for outdoor calls. Overall, for all calls, the on-scene to patient interval accounted for 28\% of the actual response interval. When an on-scene escort provided assistance in locating and reaching the patient, the on-scene to patient interval decreased from 2.3 to 1.9 minutes. The total dispatch to patient arrival interval was less than 4 minutes in 8.7\%, less than 6 minutes in 28.5\%, and less than 8 minutes in 55.7\% of calls. Conclusions: The time from arrival on-scene to the patient's side is an important component of overall response time in large urban areas, particularly in multistory buildings.},

	abstract = {Response time is a very important factor in determining the quality of prehospital EMS. Our objective was to model the response by Israeli ambulances and to offer model-derived strategies for improved deployment of ambulances to reduce response time. Using a geographic information system (GIS), a retrospective review of computerized ambulance call and dispatch logs was performed in two different regional districts, one large and urban and the other rural. All calls that were pinpointed geographically by the GIS were included, and their data were stratified by weekday and by daily shifts. Geographic areas (polygons) of, at most, 8 minutes response time were simulated for each of these subgroups to maximize the timely response of calls. Before using the GIS model, mean response times in the Carmel and Lachish districts were 12.3 and 9.2 minutes, respectively, with 34\% and 62\% of calls responded within 8 minutes. When ambulances were positioned within the modeled polygons, more than 94\% of calls met the 8-minute criterion. The GIS simulation model presented in this study suggests that EMS could be more effective if a dynamic load-responsive ambulance deployment is adopted, potentially resulting in increased survival and cost-effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Emergency medical services (EMS) administrators seek methods to enhance system performance. One component scrutinized is the response time (RT) interval between call receipt and arrival on scene. While reducing RTs may improve survival, this remains speculative and unreported. Objective: To determine the effect of current RTs on survival in an urban EMS system. Methods: The study was conducted in a metropolitan county (population 620,000). The EMS system is a single-tier, paramedic service and provides all service requests. The 90\% fractile RT specifications required for county compliance include 10:59 minutes for emergency life-threatening calls (priority I) and 12:59 minutes for emergency non-life-threatening calls (priority II). All emergency responses resulting in a priority I or priority II transport to a Level 1 trauma center emergency department over a six-month period were evaluated to determine the relation between specified and arbitrarily assigned RTs and survival. Results: Five thousand, four hundred twenty-four transports were reviewed. Of these, 71 patients did not survive (1.31\%; 95\% CI = 1.04\% to 1.67\%). No significant difference in median RTs between survivors (6.4 min) and nonsurvivors (6.8 min) was noted (p = 0.10). Further, there was no significant difference between observed and expected deaths (p = 0.14). However, mortality risk was 1.58\% for patients whose RT exceeded 5 minutes, and 0.51\% for those whose RT was under 5 minutes (p = 0.002). The mortality risk curve was generally flat over RT intervals exceeding 5 minutes. Conclusions: In this observational study, emergency calls where RTs were less than 5 minutes were associated with improved survival when compared with calls where RTs exceeded 5 minutes. While variables other than time may be associated with this improved survival, there is little evidence in these data to suggest that changing this system's response time specifications to times less than current, but greater than 5 minutes, would have any beneficial effect on survival.},

In a difference-in-difference analysis, I compare the change in housing investment before and after the program among participating households to the change in investment among two samples of nonparticipants. My results indicate that strengthening property rights in urban slums has a significant effect on residential investment: the rate of housing renovation rises by more than two-thirds of the baseline level. The bulk of the increase is financed without the use of credit, indicating that changes over time reflect an increase in investment incentives related to lower threat of eviction.},

I then trace the precedents of these American institutions to the evolution of common law in England, where interests unconcerned with the Crown coalesced to form competing political units.

In The Mystery of Capital, the world-famous Peruvian economist takes up the question that, more than any other, is central to one of the most crucial problems the world faces today: Why do some countries succeed at capitalism while others fail?In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly informal, extralegal ownership to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is also what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book will revolutionize our understanding of capital and point the way to a major transformation of the world economy.},

At the time of data collection, only part of the community was covered by the primary health care program. We conducted semistructured interviews with 14 adults, both with and without access to the public primary care program. Regardless of program coverage, participants noted barriers and negative experiences while accessing public health care. The perceived inability of health professionals to deal compassionately with a low-income population was prominent in their narratives, and in the expressed motivation for pursuing private sector health care alternatives. We explore the tension arising from the more recent rights-based health care provision and historic social control and assistentialist framing of state intervention in Brazilian favelas.},

In the context of such social consensus, it is unthinkable to question access to emergency healthcare through the prism of discrimination and social inequality. Yet these social representations of emergency do not withstand ethnographic inquiry. Several years spent behind the scenes in this world revealed that there do in fact exist social selection practices in the realm of emergency care in France. More specifically, this study shows that medical interests and the interests of both public and private institutions have led to the production of socially differentiated pathways of access to emergency care. The first pathway is through private, for-profit clinics, the second is through public hospitals, a third occurs by “bypassing” the emergency department, and a final one groups the non-governmental social and health assistance structures. In this article, we discuss the specific mechanisms they have for selecting patients, and show how the organization of emergency care in France contributes to reproducing or even aggravating inequalities in health and access to healthcare.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to geospatially model the level of geographic accessibility to health facilities among Amazonian Indigenous communities in a region of Peru.
Methods: Spatial modeling of the physical accessibility of the Indigenous communities to the nearest health facility was performed through cost-distance analysis. The study area was Loreto, the region with the largest territorial area and number of Indigenous communities in Peru. The time required to reach a health facility was determined by cumulatively adding the time needed to cross the grids on the lowest cost route from the Indigenous communities’ locations to the nearest health facility, by considering Amazonian geographical conditions and the main types of transport used.
Results: The median time to reach a health facility was 0.96 h (interquartile range: 0.45e2.41). Of the total communities (n ¼ 1043), only 479 (45.93\%) communities were within 1 h from the nearest health facility, and 161 (15.44\%) were more than 8 h away. The Indigenous communities more than 8 h away from a health establishment were located in the border areas of the department of Loreto.
Conclusion: One in two Indigenous communities is more than 1 h from the nearest health facility.},

	abstract = {Background: Oral health inequalities are profound worldwide. Despite major improvements in oral health, inequalities exist for many racial and ethnic groups, by socioeconomic status, gender, age, and geographic location. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate trends of socio-economic inequalities in access to oral health services in Peru before and after the implementation of Universal Health Assurance (AUS).
Methods: Analytical cross-sectional study based on the National Household Survey on Living Conditions and Poverty (ENAHO) 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2017. Two periods were defined before and after the AUS Law (2009). Use of oral health services was the dependent variable, for the general population and according to ages, the area of residence, and natural region. Measurements of inequality in the use of health services were made based on the concentration curves (CC), dominance test and concentration index (CI).
Results: We included a number of 85,436 (2004), 88,673 (2008), 87,074 (2010) and 124,142 (2017) participants. The proportion of people who used oral health services was 8.4\% (2014), 10.1\% (2008), 10.6\% (2010) and 10.4\% (2017). Use of oral health services showed an increase in different age groups, urban and rural areas, and natural regions of residence during the study period. The CC were distributed below the line of equality, indicating an inequality of use of oral health services, in favor of the richest groups and dominance of the CC in 2017 over the previous years. Changes in the CI were statistically significant for {\textless} 5 years and in the rural area, and for the period 2010-2017 they were also significant in the general population, children aged 5-17 years, urban area, and Andean and Jungle regions, which indicates a reduction in the concentration of use of these services in these groups.
Conclusions: The use of oral health services in Peru increased and inequality decreased in the period 2004-2017, coinciding with the implementation of the AUS. However, the use of these services continue having a distribution in favor of the richest populations. It requires the introduction of new strategies and oral health programs in the Peruvian population, with the aim of closing the gap currently mediated by the economic possibilities.},

	abstract = {Health is a universal right, nevertheless, not all people have the same opportunities to fully enjoy it without facing financial difficulties. Universal Health Coverage has the potential to break the health-poverty trap, supporting people with the opportunity of building a healthy structure, essential for a sustainable human and economic development. This paper explores how individual characteristics matter for taking part in Universal Health Coverage in Peru for years 2009 and 2018. Two National Household Surveys and different probit models were used for estimating a) the likelihood of being enrolled in a health insurance b) the likelihood of being enrolled in SIS or EsSalud c) the likelihood of receiving full financial coverage of health services expenses by the health insurance and d) the likelihood of perceiving certain barrier as the reason for not using health facilities when facing a health event. Overall, results suggest in most cases the marginal effect of a vulnerable characteristic on the likelihood of the outcomes of interest has reduced over the years. Nevertheless, there are still health inequities and inequalities concerning participation in UHC in Peru.},

	abstract = {Objective The aim of the study was to explore the presence of inequalities in the use of dental services among {\textless}12-year-old children residing in Peru, according to their wealth quintile and natural region of residence. Methods This was a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of the 2017 Demographic and Family Health Survey of Peru (n = 39 881 children). Generalized Poisson regression models, adjusted for gender, age, maternal ethnicity, place of residence and health coverage, were used to study the association between wealth quintile and use of dental services followed by stratified models by the natural region (Metropolitan Lima, coast, Andes mountains and jungle) and predicted probability graphs to study the effect of the natural region on inequalities in the use of dental services. Results Inequalities in the use of dental services among children were observed according to the wealth quintile and natural region. A social gradient was present in the Andes mountains, coast and jungle regions. The greatest inequalities were observed in the coast (richest vs poorest quintile PR = 1.81 95\% CI = 1.56-2.11) and jungle regions (richest vs poorest quintile PR = 1.81 95\% CI = 1.53-2.14). The jungle presented the lowest proportion of children using dental services, while Metropolitan Lima had the highest proportion. No significant differences were observed between wealth quintiles among children from Metropolitan Lima. Conclusions Differences in socioeconomic inequalities in the use of dental services among natural regions were observed. The distribution of dental centres and personnel, and the geographical and demographic characteristics of each region, may play an important role in the presence of the inequalities observed.},

	shorttitle = {Spatial {Health} {Inequalities}},
	abstract = {The neighborhoods and the biophysical, political, and cultural environments all play a key role in affecting health outcomes of individuals. Unequal spatial distribution of resources such as clinics, hospitals, public transportation, fresh food markets, and schools could make some communities as a whole more vulnerable and less resilient to adverse health effects. This somber reality suggests that it is rather the question of "who you are depends upon where you are" and the fact that health inequality is both a people and a place concern. That is why health inequality needs to be investigated in a spatial setting to deepen our understanding of why and how some geographical areas experience poorer health than others. This book introduces how spatial context shapes health inequalities.
Spatial Health Inequalities: Adapting GIS Tools and Data Analysis demonstrates the spatial health inequalities in six most important topics in environmental and public health, including food insecurity, birth health outcomes, infectious diseases, children’s lead poisoning, chronic diseases, and health care access. These are the topics that the author has done extensive research on and provides a detailed description of the topic from a global perspective. Each chapter identifies relevant data and data sources, discusses key literature on appropriate techniques, and then illustrates with real data with mapping and GIS techniques. This is a unique book for students, geographers, clinicians, health and research professionals and community members interested in applying GIS and spatial analysis to the study of health inequalities.},

Indeed, economic theory characterizes many cases of interactions between agents (products, firms, individuals) which are not necessarily geographically based. The document focuses on the study of the spatial correlation, and therefore these various interactions, and details the links with spatial heterogeneity, i.e. spatially differentiated phenomena. Several forms of interaction exist regarding the dependent variable, the explanatory variables or unobserved variables. Many models therefore find themselves in competition from a same prior definition of neighborhood relationships. A stepwise methodology of model selection (estimation and tests) is detailed. Feedback effects lead to a particular (and more complex) interpretation of results.},

Industrial policy is hot again, back with a new name (mission innovation) and a new target (climate change). Detractors point to past failures and the risk of costly mistakes and argue that governments should avoid picking winners and stick to carbon pricing. Is government-directed innovation a good tool for climate innovation? How can governments do it well? What should they avoid? And what lessons are there for Canada's energy transition?

Join David, Sara, Ed, and industrial policy expert Dani Rodrik of Harvard University to discuss government-directed innovation as a tool for decarbonization, on Episode 30 of Energy vs Climate.

	abstract = {La géomorphologie, science qui étudie les formes du relief terrestre, a connu de fortes évolutions ces dernières décennies. Faisant désormais la synthèse entre l’approche des géosciences et celle des sciences sociales, elle est devenue une composante majeure de la compréhension de l’environnement et une science applicable, notamment dans le domaine de la gestion des milieux et des risques naturels. Ce manuel propose une présentation renouvelée et inédite de la discipline. Après un rappel des concepts fondamentaux et méthodes spécifiques qui ont donné naissance à la géomorphologie moderne, les grandes dynamiques de la surface de la Terre sont analysées, en prenant pour cadre de référence l’unité topographique et hydrographique du bassin versant, où se développent en relais les différents processus géomorphologiques : décomposition des roches, mouvements de terrain, prise en charge des sédiments et solutés par les eaux courantes. Chaque chapitre, abondamment illustré, est assorti d’études de cas variées, issues des nombreuses pratiques de terrain effectuées par les auteurs dans le monde entier.},

	abstract = {Is green growth compatible with circular economy? An answer through the IPAT identity. The circular economy concept is currently being used in multiple ways. For some academics and organizations circular economy can be identiﬁed as a long term goal of achieved green growth while others argue that circular economy is fundamentally different from green growth. In this paper, we explore the conditions allowing green growth to be compatible with the concept of circular economy. Our model explicitly takes into account the possibility of a dematerializing of wealth production and raw material recycling through a green growth framework. We show that the reconciling of green growth with circular economy requires: (i) a fast decrease of the raw material intensity of economy far removed from present and past trajectories, (ii) the absence of a physical limitation to this decrease. This seems to indicate that green growth is essentially different from, and incompatible with the concept of circular economy.},

	title = {Émancipation},
	isbn = {9782381910345},
	abstract = {Aujourd'hui comme avant, l'émancipation suscite chez certains la méfiance. Le réflexe est bien connu : que ce soit dans le domaine du politique, de la famille, de la sexualité ou du travail, les processus d'émancipation conduisent, depuis l'avènement des sociétés modernes, à rompre avec un ordre, avec une tradition pourvoyeuse de sécurités et de confort, et à les remplacer par un saut dans l'incertain). Mais, notre actualité se singularise sur un point : à ce discours anti-émancipation s'en conjugue désormais un autre, qui vise au contraire à s'emparer du mot pour le détourner de son sens originaire. C'est ainsi que l'émancipation est devenue l'un des maîtres-mots des programmes de réformes néolibérales, que l'on trouve derrière l'éloge des émancipés de la start-up Nation, la nécessité pour chacun de « se prendre en main », de devenir l'entrepreneur de sa vie, de se responsabiliser face à ses échecs et d'assumer les risques de ses choix. Le danger existe donc que l'émancipation devienne le maître-mot du retournement de la démocratie contre elle-même, la clef-de-voûte de la novlangue exprimant la volonté de gouverner sans le peuple. Dans cet essai brillant, le sociologue Federico Tarragoni, après être revenu aux origines latines du mot (l'emancipatio du mineur et de l'esclave) et à ses évolutions sémantiques (émanciper/s'émanciper) au cours des XVIIIe et XIXe siècles en particulier, tente d'arracher l'émancipation à l'oubli et au dévoiement, afin que le mot demeure la quintessence de l'humanité, qu'il continue à désigner ses aspirations vers un monde meilleur},

Based on these, a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) epidemic model is established, where state-dependent pulse control strategy, varying total population and limited medical resources are introduced. By using the qualitative theory of ordinary diﬀerential equation, diﬀerential inequality techniques, Poincar´e map, and other methods, some suﬃcient conditions of the existence and orbital asymptotical stability of positive order-1 or order-2 periodic solution are obtained in various situations. Theoretical results imply that the proportion of infected class can be controlled at a desired low level for a long time and disease will not break out among population. Finally, based on realistic parameters of brucellosis in ruminants, numerical simulations have been performed to expalin/extend our analytical results and the feasibility of the state-dependent feedback control strategy.},

	abstract = {A risk (analysis) society? Risk as a collective experience and public issue has redeﬁned the politics and structure of contemporary societies. But risk is also, and increasingly so, an object of calculation and scientiﬁc assessment. These two phenomena are in many ways inseparable, but have seldom been analysed jointly. By ignoring the rise of a science of risk analysis and the institutionalization of riskanalytic techniques in government, and emphasizing science’s loss of scientiﬁc authority, seminal theories of risk such as Beck’s Risk society even constitute them as paradoxical. Moving beyond the seeming contradiction between these two faces of contemporary societies — a risk society and a risk analysis society — the paper shows that the capacity to engage with the sociotechnical controversies that are typical of the former, is indeed a characteristic of the regulatory sciences that pertain to the latter.},

	abstract = {Le 6 octobre 2015, la Cour de Justice de l'Union Européenne a invalidé la décision 2000/520/CE relative aux transferts de données à caractère personnel vers les États-Unis validant les principes dits de la « sphère de sécurité » ou Safe Harbor qui constituaient auparavant le fondement des transferts de données de l'Union Européenne vers les Etats-Unis. Dans un contexte d'interaction et de concurrence entre le droit de la Convention Européenne des droits de l'Homme, il est remarquable de noter que la Cour de Strasbourg a, elle aussi, opéré une condamnation stricte de la surveillance de masse dans son arrêt Zakharov de décembre 2015 et son arrêt Szabo de janvier 2016, tout en élargissant le statut de « victime » en matière de surveillance. Les trois arrêts, condamnant la surveillance de masse, apparaissent tout entier tournés vers une exigence commune de prééminence du droit et d'effectivité des recours, ce qui est inédit au regard des positions précédentes de ces juridictions. Cette nouvelle approche ne semble avoir d'autre but que d'instaurer plus aisément un dialogue direct avec les citoyens et d'instaurer une perméabilité des discours juridictionnels et des discours « militants », la révélation de l'existence du programme « Prism » par Edward Snowden jouant, en toile de fond, un rôle prééminent dans le raisonnement mené par les juges de Luxembourg et de Strasbourg. L'on peut indéniablement parler en la matière de l'émergence d'un droit « Post-Snowden », marqué de manière subtile par le développement et la légitimation des techniques de surveillance, mais aussi par la remise en cause croissante des aspects les plus liberticides de celle-ci. A cet égard, si les arrêts commentés sonnent en apparence le glas de la surveillance de masse, ceux-ci semblent également en partie aller une reconnaissance de l'inéluctabilité du développement de celle-ci, dont les effets devraient alors être contre-balancés par un contrôle effectif des cours sur les abus d'une surveillance de ce type. La frontière entre les valeurs de liberté et les valeurs de sécurité est ainsi plus que jamais mouvante et incertaine.},

	abstract = {Open data initiatives have been flourishing around the world. Staged as an unexploited resource—a new “oil“—government data rapidly became the object of all kinds of promises, from the renewal of democracy to the stimulation of innovation. Yet, as in the sciences, in which data sharing has been a driving force of transformation for long, the plea of opening data in administrations goes with a certain process of invisibilization. Indeed, such terms as “transparency,“ “free information” and above all “raw data” erase most of the traces of the conditions in which data is produced, and of its initial uses. They also take the universality of data for granted. This chapter explores the backstage of government open data, and foregrounds the processes of its production and questions its specificities. Drawing on a series of in-depth interviews in several institutions, it shows that the data are never simply and mechanically opened. Instead, it describes how raw data themselves are actually shaped. Three particularly delicate aspects of this opening process are discussed: data identification, data extraction, and data “rawification.” These operations show the sociotechnical density of raw data, the production of which ties together organizational, political and technical issues.,Depuis quelques années, les initiatives d’open data se sont multipliées à travers le monde. Présentées jusque dans la presse grand public comme une ressource inexploitée, le « pétrole » sur lequel le monde serait assis, les données publiques sont devenues objet de toutes les attentions et leur ouverture porteuse de toutes les promesses, à la fois terreau d’un renouveau démocratique et moteur d’une innovation distribuée. Comme dans les sciences, qui ont connu un mouvement de focalisation similaire sur les données et leur partage, l’injonction à l’ouverture opère une certaine mise en invisibilité. Le vocabulaire de la « libération », de la « transparence » et plus encore celui de la « donnée brute » efface toute trace des conditions de production des données, des contextes de leurs usages initiaux et pose leur universalité comme une évidence. Ce chapitre explore les coulisses de l’open data afin de retrouver les traces de cette production et d’en comprendre les spécificités. À partir d’une série d’entretiens ethnographiques dans diverses institutions, il décrit la fabrique des données brutes, dont l’ouverture ne se résume jamais à une mise à disponibilité immédiate, évidente et universelle. Il montre que trois aspects sont particulièrement sensibles dans le processus d’ouverture : l’identification, l'extraction et la « brutification » des données. Ces trois séries d’opérations donnent à voir l’épaisseur sociotechnique des données brutes dont la production mêle dimensions organisationnelles, politiques et techniques.},

	abstract = {Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice.},

	abstract = {This empirical and interdisciplinary study investigates the contribution of deeply enrooted social-political factors to the accumulation of exposure and vulnerability and amplification of cascading impacts of disasters, with implications on the creation and reinforcement of path dependency maintaining social-ecological systems on a maladaptive trajectory. Applying the Trajectory of Exposure and Vulnerability approach to Saint-Martin (Caribbean), we more specifically highlight how the causal chain linking historical geopolitical and politicalinstitutional drivers to legal, economic, demographic, sociocultural, planning-related and environmental drivers, created the accumulation of exposure and vulnerability over time and contributed to the propagation and amplification of the impacts of tropical cyclones Irma and Jos´e in 2017. We find that historical socialpolitical dynamics involving unsustainable development and settlement patterns, the weakness of local in­ stitutions, population mistrust in public authorities, high social inequalities and environmental degradation maintained Saint-Martin on a maladaptive trajectory through powerful reinforcing mechanisms operating both between and during cyclonic events. This study demonstrates that long-term interdisciplinary approaches are required for a better understanding of path dependency and the identification of levers to break it in risk-prone contexts. In Saint-Martin, breaking path dependency requires the alignment of local institutional capacities with national risk reduction policies, the promotion of social justice and involvement of local communities in decision making. This study therefore confirms the relevance of backward-looking approaches to support forward-looking climate adaptation.},

	abstract = {Le contenu des deux cours (respectivement du jeudi et du vendredi) sera donc identique, mais au sein de chaque séance, les deux parties du cours devront être appréhendées comme étant indépendantes : en bref, vous aurez donc la chance d'avoir deux cours en un, avec pour contrepartie de devoir suivre deux thèmes différents en parallèle. Les modes d'organisation au sein de chaque partie des cours - la manière dont chaque intervenant organise son enseignement et ses exigences - sont détaillés plus loin dans la rubrique "information pratique") et sont, eux, spécifiques à chaque intervenant.

Le cours de N. Sigot portera de manière centrale (mais non exclusivement) sur la pensée du XIXème siècle tandis que celui de Goulven Rubin privilégiera la pensée du XXème siècle (là encore, sans exclusive). 

Cependant une unité existe entre les deux parties du cours, tenant non seulement au domaine étudié, l'histoire de la pensée économique, mais également à certains aspects ou auteurs, abordés par les intervenants, qui se feront écho. 

De manière cohérente, les TD porteront sur l'intégralité des thèmes traités dans chaque cours : certains des dossiers seront donc plus spécifiquement reliés aux aspects développés dans la partie du cours traitée par G. Rubin, d'autres dans celle traitée par N. Sigot. (voir la rubrique "TD"). La même logique se retrouve dans la définition du sujet de partiel (voir la rubrique "partiel").},

	title = {Cours de droit public 1},
	abstract = {Le cours de droit public I s’adresse à des étudiants qui veulent préparer des concours
administratifs dans le cadre du diplôme d’université d’affaires publiques.
Au programme de ces concours figure en bonne place le droit public, d’où son caractère
obligatoire, pour des étudiants venant de formations en histoire ou en économie.
Aux termes de la brève description de son contenu, le cours porte essentiellement sur le droit
constitutionnel, ainsi que sur la hiérarchie des normes et les principes de l’organisation
administrative, tandis que le droit administratif, branche essentielle du droit public pour les
concours administratifs fera l’objet l’année suivante du cours de droit public II.
Il n’est pas envisageable de traiter en 30 heures, comme on le ferait en licence en droit où le
seul cours de droit constitutionnel occupe 72 heures, l’intégralité d’une telle matière d’autant
qu’elle s’est considérablement enrichie ces dernières décennies du fait de la montée en
puissance du droit constitutionnel normatif et du contentieux constitutionnel, questions
absolument essentielles et dont la connaissance s’impose pour maîtriser le droit public dans la
perspective d’un concours administratif.
Le cours abordera donc de manière transversale l’histoire constitutionnelle ou les régimes
étrangers, à l’occasion de l’étude de grandes questions juridiques toujours prégnantes qu’il
conviendra d’actualiser comme le pluralisme, l’exercice de la démocratie ou la séparation des
pouvoirs. Les premiers chapitres seront donc consacrés successivement, au droit de l’État, au
droit de la constitution, à la démocratie pluraliste, avant, plus classiquement de s’intéresser au
régime constitutionnel de la Vème République, à ses institutions, à son esprit et à sa pratique.
Sera ensuite abordée la question du contrôle de constitutionnalité, de ses fondements et de ses
méthodes avant d’étudier les bases constitutionnelles de l’organisation administrative.},

The space-time concept makes it possible to delimit geographical objects, such as cities, in a manner that is comparable from one period to another, in terms of the duration of journeys and the ensuing opportunities for interaction, showing up in an urban expansion in space measured in kilometres. An experiment conducted in Valence (southeastern France) shows some coincidence between the zone accessible within 30 minutes and the space covered by urban and peri-urban growth since the beginning of the 19th century.},

	abstract = {Qu’est-ce que l’État ? Au-delà de la formule prêtée à Louis XIV – « L’État, c’est moi  ! » – cette question fondamentale se pose dans des termes sans cesse renouvelés. Construit mais inachevé, l’État n’est pas un produit fini ou un modèle absolu et définitif. Au contraire, il est foncièrement appelé à évoluer dans l’espace et dans le temps. « On nous change notre État ! », s’exclamait déjà Maurice Hauriou à la fin du XIXe siècle. Aussi ce manuel vise-t-il à appréhender l’objet étatique dans ses traits ontologiques (et immuables ?) comme dans ses mutations contemporaines.À partir essentiellement du cas de la France, l’État est ici étudié à travers sa construction (théorique, historique, politique et juridique), son organisation (répartition verticale et horizontale du pouvoir), son action (via les finalités et les moyens de ses missions et fonctions) et son statut (sur le plan international). Non seulement, ces approches se veulent didactiques et complémentaires, mais elles mobilisent à la fois les sciences juridiques et politiques. Autant de caractéristiques qui font l’originalité de ce manuel sur l’État.},

	abstract = {Le débat sur le dualisme et le monisme en droit international est persistant et oppose deux conceptions antagonistes du rapport entre les ordres juridiques nationaux et l'ordre international : le dualisme tend à affirmer que les normes du droit international n'acquièrent de force juridique qu'en étant transposées en droit interne, tandis que le monisme tend à affirmer que le droit international prévaut de façon immédiate en droit interne.
Certains États tendent à favoriser l'une ou l'autre des doctrines. Le dualisme est par exemple préféré au Royaume-Uni, au Canada, en Allemagne ou encore en Italie, où les traités internationaux signés et ratifiés doivent être formellement repris par une loi interne (principe de la souveraineté parlementaire) et ont donc l'autorité de la loi qui les a intégrés dans l'ordre juridique interne. À l'inverse, en France, les traités sont applicables dès leur ratification : ils ont une position spécifique, qui est en l'occurrence supérieure aux lois internes. Cette position moniste est également adoptée aux Pays-Bas, en Suisse ou au Luxembourg. Les États-Unis ont un système mixte, selon que les traités soient ou non considérés comme étant d'application directe par les tribunaux ; dans tous les cas, les traités n'y sont pas applicables s'ils entrent en conflit avec une loi fédérale postérieure.
Au niveau des rapports entre droit communautaire et droit interne, la Cour de justice des communautés européennes (CJCE) a adopté une position moniste avec l'arrêt Costa contre ENEL de 1964.},

Sous un angle critique, il s’agit d’envisager l’intérêt et les conditions de possibilité d’un programme de recherche sur l’émergence à partir d’un double questionnement transversal. Le premier concerne l’effectivité de changements économiques, sociaux et/ou politiques d’un ordre différent de ceux que qui ont été observés jusqu’alors dans les nouveaux pays industrialisés ou dans les pays en transition. Le second, plus provocateur, renvoie à la capacité des approches et théories habituelles du développement à rendre compte des changements en cours.},

	abstract = {Cet article traite des migrations et des vulnérabilités différenciées de populations
confrontées à deux types d’aléas, des épisodes de sécheresse et des cyclones. Ces
populations sont aujourd’hui appelées migrants ou réfugiés climatiques. Quel sens peut-
on donner à ces appellations et comment se sont-elles construites ? Quels sont les débats
actuels sur la reconnaissance de cette catégorie de migrants et quelles sont les pratiques et
les profils socio-économiques de cette nouvelle catégorie de réfugiés ? Il s’agira de
questionner non seulement, le contexte de création de cette nouvelle catégorie de réfugiés
mais aussi, les pratiques migratoires des populations affectées et enfin les causes des
vulnérabilités différenciées face à des aléas climatiques semblables. Dans un premier
temps, l’histoire institutionnelle de la catégorie des réfugiés environnementaux ou éco-
réfugiés est retracée. Elle montre combien la définition très large qui lui était attribuée
s’est considérablement réduite récemment pour ne prendre en compte que les effets
humains du réchauffement climatique. Le réfugié environnemental est devenu
aujourd’hui un réfugié climatique dont l’existence est considérée comme une menace
pour la sécurité internationale en raison des estimations croissantes de son nombre et de
son absence de protection juridique. Mais derrière cette catégorie, se cache une diversité
de profils socio-économiques qui seront illustrés par deux études de cas, l’une en milieu
insulaire (populations riveraines des littoraux antillais face aux cyclones), l’autre en
milieu sahélien (éleveurs nomades peul et touareg confrontés aux sécheresses).},

Les Etats étudiés (Allemagne, Etats-Unis, France, Grande-Bretagne, Suède) par delà leurs différences, ont quatre caractéristiques communes qui semblent participer d’une certaine définition culturelle de la démocratie : ce sont des Etats-de-droit intégrant des gouvernements représentatifs respectant un certain pluralisme par séparation des pouvoirs et contribuant à une démarchandisation des conditions de vie par des politiques redistributives. Ces caractéristique seront étudiées dans chaque partie du cours en vis-à-vis de théories ou phénomènes contraires afin de ne pas réifier, ni idéaliser les concepts décrivant ainsi ces cinq Etats puis elles seront examinées chacune de façon plus concrète à travers certains développements sectoriels d’action publique : protection de l’environnement, asile et migrations, communications numériques, protection sociale… Les enjeux d’action publique étudiés sur ces secteurs le seront tant au regard du concept principal que d’un aspect contraire choisi parmi ceux identifiés dans sa présentation théorique.},

Au premier semestre, le cours de L3 présente i) les techniques de formation du droit
international, en insistant plus particulièrement sur le mode conventionnel ; ii) la question des
rapports entre le droit international et le droit interne, au départ de la problématique de
l’application interne du droit international ; iii) la figure de l’Etat, en tant que sujet historique
et central du droit international et, enfin, iv) les grands traits de la condition internationale des

	abstract = {Cet enseignement a trois objectifs :

- Le premier est de montrer la pertinence d’une approche des questions sociales par la géographie. Tous les champs de la géographie humaine (géographie économique, sociale, politique, culturelle) sont mobilisés pour expliquer que l’espace n’est pas un contenant neutre dans lequel s’inscrit la société, mais un produit social. La géographie intervient de façon légitime sur des problèmes sociaux et sociétaux contemporains importants.

- Le deuxième objectif est de montrer aux étudiants que d'autres disciplines de sciences humaines apportent beaucoup à une meilleure compréhension des enjeux spatiaux. En particulier, des auteurs venus de la sociologie, l'anthropologie, la science politique, ou encore l'économie (surtout l'économie qui ne se limite pas aux équations macro-économétriques et analyse les institutions sociales et les stratégies d'acteurs) doivent être connus des étudiants afin qu'ils ne pensent pas que l'espace serait un objet scientifique réservé aux seuls géographes.

- Le troisième objectif est de former les étudiants à l'analyse d'articles scientifiques - ce qui commence par une bonne maîtrise des règles de l'écriture universitaire et de la technique du commentaire de document. 

Chaque semaine, le cours (CM) traite d’une question ou d'une approche scientifique particulière des enjeux sociaux, qui est retravaillée dans les TD à partir de textes scientifiques dont la lecture critique est obligatoire. Ces textes, qui sont le coeur de cet enseignement, sont accessibles sur l'EPI "TD".

Le semestre comporte deux grandes parties: la première porte sur l'espace social mondial et en particulier ce qui peut apparaître comme la distinction entre l'Occident et le reste du monde; la seconde sur l'échelle urbaine, les questions migratoires, d'ethnicité et de genre.

Le partiel de fin de semestre sera centré sur les textes qui sont au cœur de cet enseignement, et qui sont disponibles sur la page "TD" de l'EPI. Tous les étudiants doivent s'être appropriés la TOTALITE de ces textes.},

	url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01356721},
	abstract = {Ce travail présente une nouvelle approche de modélisation des phénomènes de panique dans le cadre de crise. L’approche proposée vise à couvrir la dimension cognitive, émotionnelle et physique de l’individu et repose sur une modélisation épidémiologique du processus de propagation de la panique. Le modèle se décompose en deux grandes parties interdépendantes et complémentaires à savoir une étude de la mobilité et une étude des phénomènes de panique. L’étude de la mobilité est à la base du modèle, elle est construite selon une approche individu-centrée où les individus interagissent entre eux et avec leurs environnements pour produire des comportements cohérents. Le modèle de panique vient s’ajouter comme une couche qui peut modifier le patron de mobilité en modifiant l’écoulement du système. La mobilité et la panique forment par conséquent un système complexe dans lequel ils interagissent et s’influencent mutuellement faisant apparaître des propriétés émergentes d’amplification et/ou de régulation. Ce travail s’intéresse également à une étude agrégative du processus de propagation de la panique. Cette étude de propagation de la panique à un niveau de granularité différent. Nous proposons une formulation mathématique du modèle par des équations différentielles ordinaires (EDO), puis nous étudions la dynamique de croissance de la population des individus paniqués ainsi que la dynamique de diffusion de la panique. Cette démarche mixte de travail permet de renforcer la complémentarité entre les modèles comportementaux microscopiques et les modèles dynamiques macroscopiques dans l’étude des phénomènes concrets sur divers échelles et de description.},

Dans certains États, le traumatisme de la colonisation est encore vif alors que des pays comme l’Éthiopie tirent profit de leurs liens avec l’extérieur, notamment avec la Chine. 
Bien que la forte natalité, l’accès à l’éducation et la transition démocratique soient des problématiques concernant l’ensemble du continent, son avenir varie largement suivant les régions et pays. Dès lors, que répondre à ceux qui affirment que l’Afrique sera le continent de demain, et ceux qui à l’inverse prédisent une évolution démographique, économique et écologique dramatique entraînant la fameuse « ruée vers l’Europe » ? 

Nicolas Normand a été ambassadeur de France en Afrique du Sud, au Mali, au Congo, au Sénégal et en Gambie. Il publie "Le Grand livre de l’Afrique" aux  Éditions Eyrolles.

	abstract = {La tropicalité désigne les caractéristiques physiques des régions de la zone intertropicale. Cette zone a longtemps fait l’objet d’un discours géographique spécifique, la géographie tropicale, avatar de la géographie coloniale. La tropicalité désigne aujourd’hui un ensemble de contraintes et de potentialités communes aux milieux tropicaux.
 	Au sens astrophysique, la zone intertropicale est délimitée par le tropique du Capricorne au sud et le tropique du Cancer au nord. En géographie, c’est plutôt la définition climatique de la zone intertropicale qui domine, au sens des régions situées de part et d’autre de l’Équateur, sous l’influence des alizés et ne connaissant pas le gel. L’alternance entre une saison sèche et une saison des pluies, éventuellement couplées à deux saisons de transition, des températures moyennes annuelles élevées, une faible amplitude thermique annuelle (n’excluant pas de très fortes amplitudes à l’échelle de la journée) peuvent être des caractéristiques de la tropicalité. Les contraintes du climat tropical s’expriment très différemment selon les régions, du climat hyperaride au climat de mousson en passant par tous les types de savanes, et selon les situations locales, en fonction par exemple des effets de versant ou de l’altitude.
 	Comme la notion de « climat tempéré », le terme est donc commode mais en première approche uniquement. Il n’est pas exempt d’un certain poids historique de son usage (mêlant déterminisme naturel et européocentrisme), et il regroupe une très grande variété de situations régionales et locales, deux éléments incitant à la prudence quant à son utilisation.

En plus des liens, les nœuds possèdent la plupart du temps un ensemble d’attributs (âge d’un utilisateur, son sexe). Un attribut particulièrement intéressant à prendre en compte dans la modélisation est le texte (en général les publications), central dans l’analyse des réseaux de type Twitter, ou Facebook. De nombreuses méthodes d’analyse de données et d’apprentissage automatique permettent d’analyser les graphes avec attributs textuels, qui sont des objets a priori complexes. Le module sera découpé en trois parties : 1) une introduction théorique sur les graphes ; 2) une session pratique sur leur manipulation/visualisation grâce au logiciel Gephi ; 3) une présentation des travaux récents conduits au laboratoire ERIC sur les graphes avec attributs textuels.},

	abstract = {La sécheresse ou sècheresse {\textbackslash}sɛʃ.ʁɛs{\textbackslash} définit l'état d'un environnement confronté à un manque d'eau significativement long et important pour qu'il ait des impacts sur la flore (naturelle ou cultivée), la faune (sauvage ou d'élevage) et les sociétés. Sécheresse ne doit pas être confondu avec aridité. Une région aride peut connaître des épisodes de sécheresse.
Le déficit hydrique est une situation naturelle du point de vue de la variabilité climatique (par exemple, les périodes glaciaires/interglaciaires du Quaternaire, les cycles El Niño / La Niña, etc.) mais, selon certains climatologues certaines situations de déficit hydrique sont amplifiées (durée, extension spatiale, intensité) par l'émission humaine de gaz à effet de serre. Il fait suite à un déficit pluviométrique, sur de longues périodes durant lesquelles les précipitations sont anormalement faibles ou insuffisantes pour maintenir l'humidité du sol et l'hygrométrie normale de l'air. Il peut être aggravé ou expliqué par des pompages, une baisse du niveau de la nappe phréatique, l'érosion et la dégradation des sols (l'humus favorise la rétention de l'eau, la coupe à blanc de zones forestières dans la région de l'Amazonie, par exemple, entraîne rapidement la perte de cet humus essentiel à la rétention de l'eau et cause une désertification accélérée d'origine anthropique), une augmentation de l'évapotranspiration induite par des plantations consommatrices d'eau (peupliers, maïs).
La sécheresse peut détruire les récoltes (partiellement ou totalement) et tuer les animaux d'élevage, et parfois sauvages. Elle devient alors un facteur de famine régionale et d'exode, souvent accompagnée de troubles sociaux voire de conflits armés en particulier dans les régions de peu de ressources économiques.
La sécheresse n'est donc pas qu'un phénomène physique ou climatique objectif. C'est aussi une notion relative qui reflète l'écart entre la disponibilité de l'eau et la demande en eau de l'homme (savoir les applications agricoles – agriculture, abreuvage du bétail – industrielles, domestiques de l'eau – hygiène, alimentation, lavage – dont certains usages d'une nécessité secondaire  – piscine, arrosage des gazons, lavage de voiture – , etc.). Ceci rend toute définition de la sécheresse relative au contexte géopolitique et sociologique ; l'état « normal » de disponibilité de l'eau change selon les zones biogéographiques et les besoins réels ou ressentis des individus et des sociétés.
La sécheresse s'initie par une sécheresse météorologique se produisent généralement lorsqu'un anticyclone s'installe durablement au-dessus d'une région à cause d'une situation de blocage. Les hautes pressions persistantes empêchent donc toute intrusion d'une perturbation atmosphérique et peuvent alors mener la région surplombée par celles-ci à une longue période de beau temps et donc avec un peu voire sans précipitations.},

Par extension, la circulation cyclonique est la direction que prendra le flux d'air autour d'une dépression ou d'un creux barométrique, soit anti-horaire dans l'hémisphère nord et horaire dans celui du sud,. Même si toute dépression peut être appelée un cyclone, ce terme est le plus souvent réservé à certains types particuliers de systèmes qui se forment au-dessus des eaux chaudes des mers tropicales, les cyclones tropicaux. On applique également le suffixe cyclone à certains phénomènes de très petites échelles où une rotation se produit.},

	abstract = {L’hindouisme (hindi : hindu dharm ; devanāgarī : हिन्दू धर्म ; tamoul : இந்து சமயம் ; « religion hindoue »), ou sanatana dharma, (sanskrit IAST : sanātanadharma, en écriture devanāgarī : सनातनधर्म ; « Loi Éternelle »), est l'une des plus anciennes religions du monde encore pratiquées qui n'a ni fondateur, ni dogme imposé, ni institution cléricale organisée uniformément (les brâhmanes peuvent être de différentes écoles),. En 2015, le nombre de fidèles est estimé à 1,1 milliard, dans 85 pays, c'est actuellement la troisième religion la plus pratiquée dans le monde après le christianisme et l'islam. Elle est issue du sous-continent indien qui reste son principal foyer de peuplement.
Le terme persan hindu (du sanskrit Sindhu) désignait au départ, pour les musulmans qui pénétrèrent en Inde, les habitants du bassin de l'Indus.
La majorité des hindous ont foi en l'autorité du Veda, considéré comme « permanent » (nitya), qui fut révélé aux hommes de façon « non-humaine » (अपौरुषेय, apauruṣeya) par Brahmā et grâce à l'« audition » des Rishi (c'est-à-dire les « Sages ») ; c'est l'avis des traditions brahmaniques comme le Vedanta et la Mîmâmsâ, mais pas pour les écoles philosophiques brahmaniques Nyâya et Vaisheshika qui reconnaissent l'autorité du Véda tout en le considérant anitya (« impermanent ») et paurusheya (« humain »). Les auteurs de textes védiques ne sont pas tous identifiés, ou bien de façon légendaire comme Vyāsa.
L'hindouisme se présente comme un ensemble de concepts philosophiques issus d'une tradition remontant à la protohistoire indienne, la pratique hindouiste étant sans doute issue d'une tradition orale très ancienne, proche de l'animisme. On retient parfois une tripartition historique qui fait de l'hindouisme la dernière phase du développement des religions en Inde, après le védisme (env. 1500-500 avant notre ère) et le brahmanisme (-600 à 500 de l'ère courante).
Au-delà du syncrétisme théologique, l'hindouisme d'avant l'islam et le colonialisme européen qui soumirent l'Inde à leur autorité était un vecteur de toutes les sciences de son époque : le droit, la politique, l'architecture, l'astronomie, la philosophie, la médecine ayurvédique et d'autres savoirs qui avaient en commun le substrat religieux.},

Les sciences sociales enquêtent sur les enjeux sociaux, éthiques, politiques et économiques de ces transformations.

	url = {http://christophe.genolini.free.fr/webTutorial/aTelecharger/PetitManuelDeS4.pdf},
	abstract = {Ce livre est un guide à la programmation objet sous R (ou S4). Il ne nécessite pas de
connaı̂tre la programmation orientée objet. Par contre, un minimum de connaissances sur
R et sur la programmation en général est requis. Pour ceux qui sont totalement débutants
en R, nous vous recommandons “R pour les Débutants”, d’Emmanuel Paradis [4].
Le présent manuel est découpé en quatre parties. Après une introduction générale
sur la programmation objet (section 1) et une définition un peu plus formelle (section 2),
un exemple est présenté (section 3). Grave problème que celui du choix de l’exemple :
les exemples réels sont trop compliqués. Les artificiels sont inintéressants. Nous allons
donc utiliser une simplification d’un problème réel ayant donné lieu à la construction
d’un package (package kml). Il nous accompagnera tout au long de ce livre pour finir
sous forme d’un package appelé miniKml disponible sur le site du CRAN.
La deuxième partie présente les bases de la programmation objet. Chaque élément
nouvellement introduit est ajouté aux précédents et permet au package de prendre corps.
C’est là que sont présentés les éléments fondamentaux de la programmation S4. Cette
partie est simple, rédigée pour les débutants, mais indispensable pour comprendre la
programmation objet en S. Les sections 4, 5, 6, 7 doivent se lire préférentiellement dans
l’ordre.
Dans la troisième partie sont abordés des sujets plus subtils, comme les signatures
complexes (section 8), l’héritable (section 9) ou la super assignation pour modification
interne d’un objet (section 10). Elles ne sont pas indispensables à la programmation
objet, on peut lire l’une sans l’autre et surtout les omettre en première lecture. Cela
dépend ensuite des besoins de chacun.
En espérant que ce livre fera naitre de nombreux package S4,
bonne lecture !},

	abstract = {La Réserve fédérale (officiellement en anglais : Federal Reserve System, souvent raccourci en Federal Reserve ou Fed) est la banque centrale des États-Unis. Elle est créée en décembre 1913, durant les fêtes, par le Federal Reserve Act dit aussi Owen-Glass Act, à la suite de plusieurs crises bancaires, dont la panique bancaire américaine de 1907. Son rôle évolue depuis et elle renforce son indépendance lors de l'instabilité monétaire des années 1975 et 1985.
Le Congrès des États-Unis définit trois objectifs de politique monétaire dans le Federal Reserve Act : plein emploi, stabilité des prix et taux d'intérêt à long terme modérés. Les deux premiers sont souvent appelés le « double objectif » ou « double mandat » de la Fed. Outre la politique monétaire, la Fed est maintenant chargée de superviser et réguler le système bancaire, de maintenir la stabilité du système financier, et d'offrir des prestations financières aux organismes de dépôt, au gouvernement fédéral, et aux institutions financières étrangères. Elle étudie de surcroît l'économie américaine, et publie de nombreux rapports, tels que le livre beige, un résumé des conditions économiques dans chaque région.
La Réserve fédérale se compose d'un conseil des gouverneurs (dont Jerome Powell est le président depuis 2018), du Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), de douze banques régionales (Federal Reserve Banks), des banques membres, et de plusieurs conseils consultatifs,. Le FOMC est le comité responsable de la politique monétaire ; il se compose des sept membres du bureau des gouverneurs et des douze présidents des banques régionales (dont cinq seulement ont le droit de vote à un moment donné). La Réserve fédérale comporte ainsi des aspects publics et privés : cette structure est unique au monde pour une banque centrale, et correspond à une volonté de répondre à la fois à l'intérêt public et à ceux, privés, des banques membres. Une autre particularité du système monétaire américain est que ce n'est pas la banque centrale mais le département du Trésor qui crée la monnaie fiduciaire.
La Fed est une banque centrale indépendante : ses décisions ne sont pas sujettes à l'autorisation du président des États-Unis ou d'une autre partie du gouvernement fédéral, elle ne reçoit pas de budget du Congrès, et les mandats des gouverneurs sont beaucoup plus longs que ceux des élus fédéraux. Le gouvernement peut cependant exercer un contrôle : l'autorité de la Fed est définie par le Congrès et celui-ci peut exercer son droit de surveillance (congressional oversight). Les membres du bureau des gouverneurs, y compris le président et le vice-président, sont nommés par le président des États-Unis et confirmés par le Sénat. Le gouvernement nomme également les hauts fonctionnaires de la banque et fixe leur salaire. Toutes les banques commerciales autorisées à exercer en dehors d'un seul État sont obligatoirement membres de la Réserve fédérale régionale où se trouve leur siège et détiennent des parts dans celle-ci, ce qui autorise ces banques à élire une partie des membres du bureau de chaque Réserve fédérale régionale. Le gouvernement fédéral reçoit tous les profits de la Fed, hormis un dividende de 6 \% versé aux banques membres.},

	abstract = {Au Centre national de recherches agronomiques de Bambey, en plein cœur du Sénégal, des chercheurs améliorent les variétés de mil. Reportage.

Cultivé depuis 5 000 ans sur les vastes étendues du Sahara, le mil est devenu l’aliment phare des régions désertiques et semi-désertiques et la base quotidienne de l’alimentation des 50 millions de personnes vivant dans le Sahel.

Au Sénégal, c’est première culture en superficie mais la deuxième en termes de production après le riz. Ses atouts : elle pousse avec très peu d’eau : 250 mm par an, quand il en faut 350 mm pour le sorgho et 750 mm pour le maïs et le riz et peut fleurir jusqu’à une température de 42 °C.

Pourtant, cette graminée ne résistera pas au réchauffement climatique. Des modélisations prévoient une baisse de ses rendements de 30 \% d’ici à 2050. Alors, pour éviter des catastrophes alimentaires, des agronomes tentent de concevoir des variétés plus résistantes. C’est le cas du Thialack 2, une variété homologuée au Sénégal en 2011 et cultivée aussi au Burkina et au Niger. Le Monde Afrique s’est rendu à Bambey où depuis les années soixante, des chercheurs se succèdent pour améliorer les variétés de mil.},

https://www.eudebates.tv/​
In the 1950s, when an embryonic European Union was taking shape, national leaders had to improvise every time they wanted to meet. But the need to respond to pressing events in Europe and in the rest of the world, as well as the determination of some, would gradually transform their informal chats into the decision-making centre that we know today. This documentary looks at the story of the European Council through the eyes of those who witnessed its impressive transformation.

	abstract = {Millet is the cereal best adapted to arid and semi-arid zones. It still constitutes, along with sorghum, the staple food of the diet of Sahelian populations, for whom it remains an uncontested plant of civilisation. However, with a demographic growth of over 3 percent a year, most Sahelian populations are today in a state of chronic food shortage. This is the case in Niger, where the trend in national cereal production is a deficit of about 20 percent. The cereal needs of Niger population will double between now and the year 2020, and by the year 2050 will have grown by 4 or 5 times. At current rates, the national production of cereals, 80 percent of which is millet, is far too low to cover these needs. Rapid increase of yields and a deceleration of demographic growth are more than ever necessary to avoid massive recourse to food imports and to food aid.,Le mil est la céréale la mieux adaptée aux zones semi-arides et arides. Il constitue toujours, avec le sorgho, la base de l’alimentation et la plante de civilisation incontournable des populations du Sahel. Cependant les populations sahéliennes, dont la croissance démographique dépasse les 3 \% par an, sont déjà pour la plupart en situation d’insécurité alimentaire chronique. C’est le cas en particulier au Niger, où le déficit tendanciel de la production nationale est aujourd’hui de l’ordre de 20 \%. Les besoins de la population nigérienne vont être multipliés par 2 d’ici à 2020, et par 4 ou 5 à l’horizon 2050. Le rythme actuel de croissance de la production nationale de céréales, constituée à 80 \% de mil, est beaucoup trop faible pour faire face à ces besoins. Une augmentation rapide des rendements et une réduction de la croissance démographique apparaissent plus que jamais nécessaires pour éviter un recours de plus en plus important aux importations de céréales et à l’aide alimentaire.},

	abstract = {Org-mode est un mode de l'éditeur de texte GNU Emacs. Ce mode a été conçu pour permettre l'édition avancée de documents en texte simple et couvre différents cas d'utilisations : rédaction et suivi de listes de tâches à planifier et à réaliser, prise de notes (réflexions personnelles ou prises de notes de réunion) et publications de documents sous divers formats (HTML, PDF via LaTeX). Ainsi, des composants d'une liste de choses à faire peuvent se voir attribuer des échéances temporelles, des tags, des priorités...
L'intérêt particulier d'Org-mode est d'une part son extensibilité et d'autre part son intégration avec l'environnement Emacs. Org-mode s'intègre avec d'autres composants d'Emacs (comme BBDB, Gnus, VM, Wanderlust) ou des outils tiers comme Firefox, afin de maintenir des références vers des informations nécessaires à la réalisation d'une tâche (liens web, emails, coordonnées d'une personne par exemple).
Org-mode est un outil compatible avec la méthode d'organisation personnelle GTD (Getting Things Done) et en reprend certains points clefs (collecte régulière des choses à faire via le module remember.el (remplacé depuis par org-capture), planification, revue, tri...).
Org-mode peut aussi avec profit être utilisé comme langage de balisage léger. Dans ce cas, les documents cibles nativement supportés peuvent être en HTML, LaTeX, OpenDocument, iCalendar ou en texte pur. Org-mode est distribué avec quatre autres formats d'export pris en charge (mais non activés par défaut), que sont Beamer (une classe LaTeX pour créer des présentations), Markdown, Texinfo et sous forme de man-page Unix. Org peut également être utilisé comme outil de programmation lettrée, voire de recherche reproductible (en).
Org-mode dispose enfin d'extensions permettant de lire et d'éditer ses notes depuis des téléphones, notamment sur iOS et Android.
Org-mode fait partie d'Emacs depuis sa version 22, mais il est également disponible séparément.},

	abstract = {Exploring more than seventy-five well-known paradoxes in mathematics, philosophy, physics, and the social sciences showing how reason and logic can dispel the illusion of contradiction.Paradox is a sophisticated kind of magic trick. A magician's purpose is to create the appearance of impossibility, to pull a rabbit from an empty hat. Yet paradox doesn't require tangibles, like rabbits or hats. Paradox works in the abstract, with words and concepts and symbols, to create the illusion of contradiction. There are no contradictions in reality, but there can appear to be. In Sleight of Mind, Matt Cook and a few collaborators dive deeply into more than 75 paradoxes in mathematics, physics, philosophy, and the social sciences. As each paradox is discussed and resolved, Cook helps readers discover the meaning of knowledge and the proper formation of concepts—and how reason can dispel the illusion of contradiction. The journey begins with “a most ingenious paradox” from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance. Readers will then travel from Ancient Greece to cutting-edge laboratories, encounter infinity and its different sizes, and discover mathematical impossibilities inherent in elections. They will tackle conundrums in probability, induction, geometry, and game theory; perform “supertasks”; build apparent perpetual motion machines; meet twins living in different millennia; explore the strange quantum world—and much more.},

https://www.eudebates.tv/​
In the 1950s, when an embryonic European Union was taking shape, national leaders had to improvise every time they wanted to meet. But the need to respond to pressing events in Europe and in the rest of the world, as well as the determination of some, would gradually transform their informal chats into the decision-making centre that we know today. This documentary looks at the story of the European Council through the eyes of those who witnessed its impressive transformation.

	url = {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTltbZCsZ3M},
	abstract = {Le parcours GAM est un des 4 parcours du Master Géographies \&amp; Montagnes. Ancien DESS Montagne, il se situe dans le prolongement de la Licence 3 géographie \&amp; aménagement, parcours « aménagement(s) et environnement(s) » et du Master 1 Géographies \&amp; Montagnes. Il propose une large palette de thèmes relatifs à l’aménagement de la montagne, destinés à préparer aux futurs métiers exercés en son sein. 

Bénéficiant d’une mutualisation d’enseignements avec les parcours TMT (stations) et EPGM (urbanisme, droit, agriculture), il propose également un choix parmi 3 modules du parcours GEOSPHERES, comme éclairages sur la recherche. Les enseignements spécifiques concernent les métiers relatifs à la gestion de l’eau et aux rivières de montagne, à l’énergie, aux espaces protégés, à la gestion des collectivités territoriales ou des déchets. Comme tout parcours de master 2 à finalité professionnelle, un stage (4 à 6 mois au semestre 10) est obligatoire. Le semestre 9 est consacré en filigrane à la réalisation d’une étude de cas dans le cadre d’un atelier d’aménagement. 

Le parcours GAM est le premier à recevoir en France le label du Cluster Montagne (http://www.cluster-montagne.com​) qui regroupe 207 adhérents (dont 172 entreprises et 26 institutions) dans l’aménagement de la montagne.

Les étudiants diplômés du M2 parcours GAM entrent dans la vie active, avec des taux d’employabilité élevés, dans des bureaux d’études (dossier UTN, étude d’impact, enquête publique, PPR), collectivités territoriales (conseil départemental, communauté de communes…), territoires de projets (pays, parc naturel régional) ou administrations (DDT, EPA Parcs nationaux, DREAL…). Ils peuvent passer les concours de la fonction publique territoriale (attaché territorial).

Ils sont dotés de compétences multiples :

- une transversalité disciplinaire dans l’analyse des problématiques d’aménagement

- une distance et un regard critique par rapport à des projets d’aménagement

- une aptitude opérationnelle immédiate liée à des savoir-faire cartographique (SIG), technique (AutoCad), rédactionnel (rapport, étude, fiche synthétique) et dans la conduite d’observations (terrain)

Ils occupent des postes de chargé de mission, de responsable d’équipe, de directeur de service (urbanisme) ou de directeur général des services.

Ils travaillent dans les massifs de montagne (Alpes, Pyrénées, Massif Central, Vosges, Corse, Suisse…), mais aussi dans d’autres espaces confrontés à des réglementations (Loi Montagne, PNR) ou des problématiques d’aménagement voisines.

De plus, cette diminution est masquée par le fait que ce groupe est largement représenté par les élites politiques locales. Afin de conserver le pouvoir, ils ont recours à deux idéologies : l’idéologie des racines et l’idéologie de l’assimilation de la culture française. Ainsi, l’espace urbain reflète l’identité du groupe mais il est aussi constitutif de cette identité par le pouvoir qu’il concède. Il est le lieu où les Créoles guyanais expriment leur existence et leur volonté de domination. Dans ce champ d’investissement identitaire se dévoile aussi l’appartenance territoriale.},

	abstract = {Rasterio is a Python library that allows to read, inspect, visualize and write geospatial raster data. The library uses GeoTIFF and other spatial raster formats and is capable of working with satellite imagery, digital elevation models, and drone imagery data products. Rasterio allows you to import a single band or multiband geospatial raster in a interactive Python enviroment as Jupyter notebook, the library can keep the “duality” of the geospatial raster, that means, it can handle the location and resolution parameters as well as the matrix values of the gridded elements. 

This tutorial shows some basic procedures to explore a multiband Sentinel 2 granule with Python 3 and Rasterio on a Jupyter Notebook. The tutorial shows the comands to identify the raster array dimensions and the geospatial referencing parameters, make representation of each visible band and export band composites as true color and false color geoespatial rasters in Tiff format.

	abstract = {La crise financière de 2008, la crise économique qui a suivi et la crise de la dette souveraine dans la zone euro créent une obligation de réforme de la gouvernance économique en zone euro. À la naissance de l’euro, une coordination véritable des politiques économiques a été écartée : le choix a été fait de mettre en place un système de garde-fous contre des comportements individuels qui nuiraient à la stabilité de la zone. Ce système a montré ses limites et dans l’urgence, les pays de la zone ont réformé le cadre de politique économique de l’union monétaire. Il est indéniable que les gouvernements de la zone euro ont progressé dans la gouvernance économique. Les règles sont renforcées et surtout l’appropriation des contraintes européennes au niveau national devrait accroître le respect des règles. Néanmoins le choix assumé d’une décentralisation forte des politiques économiques porte des faiblesses. Celles-ci sont notamment une moindre transparence au niveau européen et une évaluation plus limitée des risques. En outre, le refus de permettre à la Banque centrale d’établir une distinction entre les dettes souveraines nuit à la solidité de son indépendance. La solidification de l’édifice européen passe par une délégation de l’évaluation des actions nationales par une entité commune européenne, indépendante ; la publicité de ses évaluations renforcerait le pouvoir de discipline, naturellement régulateur, du marché.

	abstract = {NOAA-20 (N20/JPSS-1/J1) is the second satellite in the US NOAA latest generation Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). N20 was launched on November 18, 2017. In conjunction with the first US satellite in JPSS series, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite launched on October 28, 2011, N20 form the new NOAA polar constellation. NOAA is responsible for all JPSS products, including SST from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer, which takes measurements in the cross-track direction within a field of view of 112.56-deg using 16 detectors and a double-sided mirror assembly. At a nominal altitude of 829 km, the swath width is 3,060 km, providing global daily coverage for both day and night passes. VIIRS has 22 spectral bands, covering the spectrum from 0.4-12 um, including 16 moderate resolution bands (M-bands). The L2P SST product is derived at the native sensor resolution ({\textasciitilde}0.75 km at nadir, {\textasciitilde}1.5 km at swath edge) using NOAA's Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system, and reported in 10 minute granules in netCDF4 format, compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification version 2 (GDS2). There are 144 granules per 24hr interval, with a total data volume of 27GB/day. In addition to pixel-level earth locations, Sun-sensor geometry, and ancillary data from the NCEP global weather forecast, ACSPO outputs include four brightness temperatures (BTs) in M12 (3.7um), M14 (8.6um), M15 (11um), and M16 (12um) bands, and two reflectances in M5 (0.67um) and M7 (0.87um) bands. The reflectances are used for cloud identification. Beginning with ACSPO v2.60, all BTs and reflectances are destriped (Bouali and Ignatov, 2014) and resampled (Gladkova et al., 2016), to minimize the effect of bow-tie distortions and deletions. SSTs are retrieved from destriped BTs. SSTs are derived from BTs using the Multi-Channel SST (MCSST; night) and Non-Linear SST (NLSST; day) algorithms (Petrenko et al., 2014). ACSPO clear-sky mask (ACSM) is provided in each pixel as part of variable l2p\_flags, which also includes day/night, land, ice, twilight, and glint flags (Petrenko et al., 2010). Fill values are reported in all pixels with \&gt;5 km inland. For each valid water pixel (defined as ocean, sea, lake or river, and up to 5 km inland), four BTs in M12/14/15/16 (included for those users interested in direct "radiance assimilation", e.g., NOAA NCEP, NASA GMAO, ECMWF) and two refelctances in M5/7 are reported, along with derived SST. Other variables include NCEP wind speed and ACSPO SST minus reference SST (Canadian Met Centre 0.1deg L4 SST). Only ACSM confidently clear pixels are recommended (equivalent to GDS2 quality level=5). Per GDS2 specifications, two additional Sensor-Specific Error Statistics layers (SSES bias and standard deviation) are reported in each pixel with QL=5. Note that users of ACSPO data have the flexibility to ignore the ACSM and derive their own clear-sky mask, and apply it to BTs and SSTs. They may also ignore ACSPO SSTs, and derive their own SSTs from the original BTs. The L2P product is monitored and validated against quality controlled in situ data provided by NOAA in situ SST Quality Monitor system (iQuam; Xu and Ignatov, 2014), using another NOAA system, SST Quality Monitor (SQUAM; Dash et al, 2010). Corresponding clear-sky BTs are validated against RTM simulation in the Monitoring IR Clear-sky Radiances over Ocean for SST system (MICROS; Liang and Ignatov, 2011). A reduced size (1GB/day), equal-angle gridded (0.02-deg), ACSPO L3U product is also available, where gridded L2P SSTs with QL=5 only are reported, and BT layers omitted.},

	abstract = {The Meteosat Second Generation (MSG-3) satellites are spin stabilized geostationary satellites operated by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) to provide accurate weather monitoring data through its primary instrument the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), which has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels. Eight of these channels are in the thermal infrared, providing among other information, observations of the temperatures of clouds, land and sea surfaces at approximately 5 km resolution with a 15 minute duty cycle. This Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset produced by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) is derived from the SEVIRI instrument on the second MSG satellite (also known as Meteosat-9) that was launched on 22 December 2005. Skin sea surface temperature (SST) data are calculated from the infrared channels of SEVIRI at full resolution every 15 minutes. L2P data products with Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES) are then derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2.0.},

The Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) is a collaboration between NASA and NOAA. The ACSPO SNPP/VIIRS L3U (Level 3 Uncollated) product is a gridded version of the ACSPO SNPP/VIIRS L2P product. The L3U output files are 10-minute granules in netCDF4 format, compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification version 2 (GDS2). There are 144 granules per 24hr interval, with a total data volume of 500MB/day. Fill values are reported at all invalid pixels, including pixels with \&gt;5 km inland. For each valid water pixel (defined as ocean, sea, lake or river, and up to 5 km inland), the following layers are reported: SSTs, ACSPO clear-sky mask (ACSM; provided in each grid as part of l2p\_flags, which also includes day/night, land, ice, twilight, and glint flags), NCEP wind speed, and ACSPO SST minus reference (Canadian Met Centre 0.1deg L4 SST). Only L2P SSTs with QL=5 were gridded, so all valid SSTs are recommended for the users. Per GDS2 specifications, two additional Sensor-Specific Error Statistics layers (SSES bias and standard deviation) are reported in each pixel with valid SST. The ACSPO VIIRS L3U product is monitored and validated against iQuam in situ data (Xu and Ignatov, 2014) in SQUAM (Dash et al, 2010).},

	abstract = {Si l’épidémie de Covid-19 provoque des retentissements inédits, il ne s’agit pas de la première pandémie que connaît l’humanité. L’Histoire récente a notamment été marquée par les grippes aviaires ou le Sida. Toutes ces maladies ont un point commun : ce sont des « zoonoses ». C’est-à-dire des maladies qui se transmettent de l’animal à l’homme.

Alors, comment expliquer que des virus, souvent issus de la vie sauvage, puissent nous contaminer ainsi de manière récurrente ? Pour un nombre croissant de scientifiques, la faute incombe aux humains eux-mêmes, qui, à travers leur développement, bouleversent les écosystèmes.

	abstract = {La théorie des jeux est un domaine des mathématiques qui s'intéresse aux interactions stratégiques des agents (appelés « joueurs »). Les fondements mathématiques de la théorie moderne des jeux sont décrits autour des années 1920 par Ernst Zermelo dans l'article Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels, et par Émile Borel dans l'article « La théorie du jeu et les équations intégrales à noyau symétrique ». Ces idées sont ensuite développées par Oskar Morgenstern et John von Neumann en 1944 dans leur ouvrage Theory of Games and Economic Behavior qui est considéré comme le fondement de la théorie des jeux moderne. Il s'agissait de modéliser les jeux à somme nulle où la somme des gains entre les joueurs est toujours égale à zéro. La théorie des jeux devient dès ce moment un outil théorique important de la microéconomie.
Depuis 1944, 11 prix Nobel d'économie ont été décernés à des économistes pour leurs recherches sur la théorie des jeux. Outre le champ de l'économie, la théorie des jeux trouve des applications dans les sciences sociales, les sciences politiques, dans l'analyse stratégique comme en relations internationales ou en théorie des organisations et en biologie évolutionniste.},
